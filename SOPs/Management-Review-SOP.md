## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Overview and Sequence**

1. **Plan the Review**

   * Frequency: at least annually, or more often if significant changes occur (e.g., new product, major nonconformity, strategic shift).
   * Quality Manager drafts MR template and collects required inputs.

2. **Collect Inputs**
   Inputs shall include, at minimum (ISO 9001 §9.3.2):

   * Status of previous MR actions
   * Changes in external/internal context relevant to the QMS
   * QMS performance and process effectiveness
   * Customer satisfaction and feedback results
   * Audit results (internal and external)
   * Nonconformities and corrective actions
   * Monitoring and measurement trends
   * Fulfillment of quality objectives
   * Status of risk and opportunity actions
   * Adequacy of resources
   * Improvement recommendations

3. **Conduct the Review**

   * Top Management reviews the MR record asynchronously or synchronously within the electronic system.
   * Key decisions and assigned actions are documented directly in the MR record.
   * Significant risks, opportunities, or strategic issues are escalated to planning or leadership processes.

4. **Determine Outputs**
   Outputs shall include, at minimum (ISO 9001 §9.3.3):

   * Decisions and actions related to QMS improvement and effectiveness
   * Updates to quality objectives and policy
   * Resource needs and assignments
   * Action items with responsibilities and due dates

5. **Document and Communicate Results**

   * Quality Manager ensures the MR record is complete and maintained in the controlled repository (e.g., GitHub issue).
   * Relevant changes to policies, objectives, or SOPs are initiated through the Change Control SOP.
   * Summary results are communicated to all affected personnel via appropriate channels.

6. **Follow-up and Closure**

   * Progress on MR actions is tracked in the Action Tracker until closure.
   * Effectiveness of actions is evaluated at the next MR.
