# **SOP – Management Review**

## **1. Purpose**

To define how the organization conducts **Management Reviews** to evaluate the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the QMS and its alignment with organizational direction.

This procedure establishes an **event-driven, dependency-based Review Cycle** that initiates Management Reviews based on meaningful organizational triggers rather than fixed time intervals.

---

## **2. Scope**

This procedure applies to all QMS activities requiring top-management oversight, including the review of performance data, risks and opportunities, audit results, policy updates, resource needs, and improvement initiatives.

Platform-specific workflows, tracking mechanisms, and templates are defined in Work Instructions (WIs).

## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Initiating a Review Cycle**

A new **Management Review Cycle** begins when one or more of the following triggers occur:

1. Completion of a major **Plan**, project, or change initiative.
2. Achievement of a defined **readiness or maturity state** (e.g., “Audit-Ready QMS”).
3. Occurrence of a **significant risk, nonconformance, incident, or compliance event**.

**Initiation process:**

* The **Quality Manager** proposes initiation.
* **Top Management** approves and designates participants.

### **Annual Requirement**

If no trigger occurs within twelve (12) months, a Management Review shall be convened to ensure the QMS is reviewed at least annually (ISO 9001:2015 §9.3.1).

### **6.2 Review Inputs**

Each Management Review shall consider, as applicable, the required inputs from ISO 9001:2015 §9.3.2, including:

1. Status of actions from previous Management Reviews.
2. Changes in external or internal issues relevant to the QMS.
3. Performance data and metrics, including achievement of quality objectives.
4. Results of audits and compliance evaluations.
5. Status and effectiveness of risk and opportunity actions.
6. Adequacy of resources, competence, and infrastructure.
7. Customer satisfaction and stakeholder feedback.
8. Process and product/service performance, including nonconformities or incidents.
9. Opportunities for improvement and innovation.

The **Quality Manager** shall ensure all required inputs are complete, current, and supported by evidence prior to the review.

### **6.3 Conducting the Review**

1. **Preparation**

   * The Quality Manager compiles verified inputs and circulates a draft agenda to participants.

2. **Discussion and Evaluation**

   * Top Management evaluates each input and assesses the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the QMS.
   * Risks, opportunities, and strategic alignment are reviewed.

3. **Decision Recording**

   * Review outcomes are documented in a **Management Review Record** and include:

     * Decisions made
     * Actions assigned
     * Responsible owners and dependencies
     * Conditions for action completion (e.g., readiness state, evidence availability)

4. **Communication**

   * Key decisions and required actions are communicated to relevant personnel.

### **6.4 Outputs of the Management Review**

Management Review outputs shall address all required outputs of ISO 9001:2015 §9.3.3 and include decisions and actions related to:

* Opportunities for improvement
* Need for changes to the QMS and its processes
* Resource or competence needs
* Improvement of product/service conformity
* Risk mitigation or opportunity exploitation
* Updates to the Quality Policy or quality objectives

Outputs shall maintain **traceability** to their corresponding inputs and be entered into the controlled Action Tracking Mechanism defined in WIs.

### **6.5 Follow-Up and Effectiveness Verification**

1. Each action arising from the Management Review shall be tracked to completion.
2. Verification confirms that actions achieved the intended result and that improvements are effective and sustainable.
3. Partially complete or partially effective actions are carried forward into the next Review Cycle.
4. Evidence of completion (metrics, plans, reports) shall be attached or referenced in the Management Review Record.
5. Verification shall occur before the next Management Review whenever feasible to ensure timely closure.
