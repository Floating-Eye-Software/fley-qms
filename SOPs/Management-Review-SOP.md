# **SOP – Management Review**

## **1. Purpose**

To define how the organization conducts **Management Reviews** that evaluate the continuing suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the QMS.
This revision introduces an **event-driven, dependency-based review-cycle system** that replaces fixed-interval scheduling with flexible triggers tied to meaningful organizational events.

---

## **2. Scope**

Applies to all QMS activities that require top-management oversight, including review of performance data, risks and opportunities, audit results, policy changes, and improvement initiatives.

## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Initiating a Review Cycle**

A new **Management Review Cycle** begins when one or more triggers occur, such as:

1. Completion of a **major plan, project, or change initiative**.
2. Achievement of a **defined readiness or maturity milestone** (e.g., *Audit-Ready QMS*).
3. Occurrence of a **significant risk, nonconformance, or compliance event**.

The **Quality Manager** proposes initiation of the cycle; **Top Management** confirms commencement and designates participants.
If no triggering event occurs within a twelve (12) month period, a Management Review shall be convened proactively to ensure the QMS is reviewed at least annually, maintaining conformance with ISO 9001:2015 §9.3.1.

### **6.2 Review Inputs**

Each review shall consider, as applicable:

1. Status of actions from previous review cycles.
2. Changes in external or internal context relevant to the QMS.
3. Performance data and metrics (objectives, KPIs, trend analysis).
4. Results of audits and evaluations of compliance.
5. Effectiveness of risk and opportunity actions.
6. Adequacy of resources, competence, and infrastructure.
7. Customer and stakeholder feedback.
8. Process and product performance, including incidents or nonconformities.
9. Emerging opportunities for improvement or innovation.

Inputs may be compiled through reports, dashboards, or linked records within the organization’s QMS tools.
The Quality Manager shall verify that all required inputs listed in ISO 9001:2015 §9.3.2 are complete, current, and supported by evidence before the review begins.
Customer satisfaction and feedback data shall include quantitative trends from the **Quality Objectives Register** or related customer metrics as defined in the **Quality-Planning-SOP**.

### **6.3 Conducting the Review**

1. **Preparation** – The Quality Manager consolidates inputs and circulates a draft agenda.
2. **Discussion and Evaluation** – Top Management reviews each input, assesses overall QMS health, and identifies needed changes.
3. **Decision Recording** – Outcomes are captured in a *Management Review Record* noting:

   * Decisions made
   * Actions assigned
   * Responsible owners and dependencies
   * Target conditions for closure (not deadlines)
4. **Communication** – Key decisions are communicated to all relevant personnel.

### **6.4 Outputs of the Management Review**

Management Review shall identify needs and opportunities for improvement, including actions related to process performance, customer satisfaction, resource adequacy, risk and opportunity status, and the effectiveness of previously implemented changes. These outputs form part of the organization’s continual improvement process.

Outputs shall include:

* Decisions and actions related to:
  * Improvement of the QMS and its processes
  * Updates to the Quality Policy or objectives
  * Resource and competence needs
  * Risk mitigation or opportunity exploitation
* Confirmation of QMS adequacy and continued alignment with organizational direction
* Identification of follow-up items for the next review cycle

Each output is entered into the **Action-Management** system for tracking and verification of effectiveness.

### **6.5 Follow-Up and Effectiveness Verification**

1. Each action from the Management Review is tracked until verified effective.
2. Verification confirms that the intended result has been achieved and sustained.
3. Any incomplete or partially effective actions are carried forward into the next review cycle.
4. Evidence of completion (plans, reports, metrics) is linked to the governing review record.
5. Verification should occur before the next scheduled or triggered Management Review to ensure closure timeliness.
