## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Overview and Sequence**

* Management Reviews (MRs) shall be conducted at planned intervals or in response to significant events.
* Each MR cycle is represented by a **review instance**, which may include a defined **milestone or tracking container** to group related objectives, risks, improvements, and opportunities.
* All outputs of the MR shall be assigned to the cycle/milestone and monitored until completion.

### **6.2 Collect Inputs**

   Inputs shall include, at minimum (ISO 9001 §9.3.2):

   * Status of previous MR actions
   * Changes in external/internal context relevant to the QMS
   * QMS performance and process effectiveness
   * Customer satisfaction and feedback results
   * Audit results (internal and external)
   * Nonconformities and corrective actions
   * Monitoring and measurement trends
   * Fulfillment of quality objectives
   * Status of risk and opportunity actions
   * Adequacy of resources
   * Improvement recommendations

### **6.3 Conduct the Review**

* Top Management reviews inputs, evaluates performance, and documents decisions and actions in the controlled record for the MR.
* Outputs (Objectives, Risks, Improvements, Opportunities) may be **tracked within a milestone or cycle container**, which remains open until all associated actions are complete.
* Each action shall be linked to the originating MR to maintain traceability.

### **6.4 Determine Outputs**

* Outputs shall include, at minimum:

  * Decisions and actions related to QMS improvement and effectiveness.
  * Updates to quality objectives and policy.
  * Resource needs and assignments.
  * Action items with responsibilities and due dates.

* Outputs may be tracked as **discrete actions assigned to the MR cycle or milestone**, with progress monitored until closure.


### **6.5 Document and Communicate Results**

* The MR record shall be complete and maintained in the controlled repository.
* The MR cycle/milestone shall remain open until all associated outputs are closed or otherwise dispositioned.
* Progress of all MR outputs shall be monitored, and any incomplete actions carried forward to the next cycle if required.
* Relevant changes to policies, objectives, or SOPs are initiated through the Change Control SOP.
* Summary results are communicated to all affected personnel via appropriate channels.

### **6.6 Follow-up and Closure**

   * Progress on MR actions is tracked in the Action Tracker until closure.
   * Effectiveness of actions is evaluated at the next MR.
