## **1. Purpose**

To ensure that all changes affecting the Quality Management System (QMS), processes, documents, software, or products are identified, reviewed, approved, implemented, and recorded in a **controlled** manner that preserves compliance, traceability, and quality integrity throughout the change lifecycle.

---

## **2. Scope**

This procedure applies to **all changes** that could affect the QMS or regulated activities, including but not limited to:

* QMS processes, procedures, or controlled documents
* Software, digital configurations, or data used in production or support
* Equipment, materials, or operational methods
* Organizational structure, roles, or resource assignments
* Product conformity, safety, or regulatory compliance

This SOP governs both **planned** and **unintended** changes.

## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Initiating a Change**

1. Any individual may propose a change by submitting a **Change Request (CR)** using the approved form or digital system.
2. Each CR must include:

   * Description and justification for the change
   * Assessment of impact on quality, compliance, or operations
   * Affected documents, systems, or processes
   * Proposed effective date (if applicable)
3. The CR is assigned a unique identifier (e.g., `CR-2025-014`).
4. The **Change Control Coordinator (CCC)** registers the CR and routes it for review.

---

### **6.2 Review and Approval**

1. The CCC assigns reviewers and approvers based on scope, risk, and potential impact.
2. Reviewers evaluate the proposal for:

   * Adequacy and completeness
   * Risks or unintended effects
   * Need for verification, validation, or training
3. Approvals are recorded in the change control system. Digital approvals or equivalent acknowledgments constitute formal authorization.
4. Once approved, the change is cleared for implementation.

> **Note:** Approval metadata (e.g., reviewer, approver, date) are stored in the control system; they do not need to appear in the controlled document itself.

---

### **6.3 Implementation**

1. Approved changes are implemented by the responsible Process Owner or designated personnel.
2. Controlled documents impacted by the change are revised and reissued under the **Document Control SOP**.
3. The current approved revision is published at the designated **controlled source**.
4. When applicable, training, communication, or validation activities are performed to ensure awareness and compliance.

---

### **6.4 Control of Unintended Changes**

1. Any unintended or unauthorized change must be documented immediately as a **Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA)**.
2. The CAPA record must include:

   * Identification of affected items
   * Description and assessment of the unintended change
   * Defined corrective and preventive actions
3. The CAPA is reviewed and verified prior to closure.
4. The CAPA record and resulting approved change together provide full traceability of the event.

---

### **6.5 Closure**

1. The CCC verifies that:

   * All affected items and documents are updated and published
   * Approvals are complete and traceable
   * Related training, communication, or validation activities are closed
   * The change record reflects the final status and outcomes
2. Once verified, the CR is formally closed and retained as part of the permanent change history.

---

### **6.6 Verification and Audit**

1. The change control process is reviewed periodically (e.g., annually) for compliance and effectiveness.
2. During audits, traceability of a change is demonstrated by linking the CR, review records, and resulting document revisions.
3. Deficiencies or nonconformities are addressed through the CAPA process.
