### **5. Procedure**

#### **5.1 Initiating a Change**

1. The initiator creates a **Change Request (CR)** using a GitHub Issue or designated form.
   Include:

   * Description and justification for the change
   * Impact assessment (on quality, compliance, or operations)
   * Related documents or systems affected
   * Proposed effective date

2. Assign a unique identifier to the CR (e.g., `CR-2025-014`).

3. Link the CR to associated Pull Requests or CAPA records where applicable.

---

#### **5.2 Review and Approval**

1. All changes must be reviewed before implementation to assess:

   * Potential risks or unintended consequences
   * Impact on product conformity or QMS integrity
   * Required updates to documentation or training

2. Reviews and approvals occur via **Pull Request review and approval in GitHub**, which serves as an authenticated digital signature.

3. The **CCC** ensures the PR includes:

   * Reference to the CR Issue number (`Fixes #XX`)
   * Updated metadata (revision, effective date, approver)
   * Git tag matching the revision after merge

---

#### **5.3 Implementation**

1. After approval, merge the PR into the `main` branch.
2. Create a Git tag corresponding to the approved revision (e.g., `SOP-004_r2`).
3. Notify relevant personnel of the approved change and its effective date.
4. Update training, documentation, or linked systems as required.

---

#### **5.4 Documentation and Records**

All changes must have the following records:

| Record Type        | Description                                     | Location                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Change Request     | Description, justification, and impact analysis | GitHub Issues or CR log       |
| Review & Approval  | Pull Request discussion and approval records    | GitHub                        |
| Implementation     | Git tag and merge commit                        | GitHub                        |
| Obsolete Documents | Archived or superseded files with tags          | Git history/archive directory |

---

#### **5.5 Control of Unintended Changes**

1. If an unintended change occurs (e.g., direct commit to `main` or unreviewed update), the issue must be:

   * Documented as a **CAPA** in GitHub Issues.
   * Reviewed to determine cause, impact, and corrective actions.
   * Linked to a corrective Pull Request implementing the fix.

2. Preventive actions may include updates to permissions, branch protection, or review requirements.

---

#### **5.6 Closure**

The CCC verifies that:

* All affected documents and records have been updated and tagged.
* The CR Issue is linked to all related PRs and Git tags.
* Evidence of approval and implementation is complete before closing the CR.
