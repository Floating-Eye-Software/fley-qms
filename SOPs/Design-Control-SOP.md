# **Standard Operating Procedure: Design and Development Control**

**Document Number:** SOP-DC-001
**Revision:** 1.1
**Effective Date:** [Insert Date]
**Approved by:** [Top Management]

---

## **1. Purpose**

To establish a standardized process for the planning, execution, review, verification, validation, and control of design and development activities in a manner compliant with ISO 9001:2015 (Clause 8.3), ensuring that all design outputs meet requirements and are auditable under the Quality Management System (QMS).

---

## **2. Scope**

This SOP applies to all products, services, and processes developed within the organization, including:

* New product or service development
* Modifications to existing products or services
* Pilot or research development projects

The SOP is framework-agnostic and may be implemented via the organizational default SDLC, the Ontario SDLC, or any other approved design framework, provided all SOP requirements are satisfied.

## **4. Definitions**

* **Design Input:** Requirements, specifications, constraints, and regulatory considerations that define the product or service.
* **Design Output:** Documented results of the design process, including drawings, specifications, procedures, and acceptance criteria.
* **Design Review:** Formal evaluation of design work at defined stages to ensure inputs are met and risks are addressed.
* **Design Verification:** Confirmation that design outputs meet design input requirements.
* **Design Validation:** Confirmation that the product or service meets user needs and intended use.
* **Design Change:** Any modification to design inputs, outputs, or procedures requiring review and approval.

| Role                       | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design Owner**           | Leads design activities, ensures compliance with SOP, oversees deliverables, coordinates reviews, and approves outputs. For projects under QMS-SOP-07, the Project Manager may serve as Design Owner. |
| **Quality Assurance (QA)** | Verifies that design control activities comply with the SOP and maintains oversight of records, reviews, and approvals.                                                                               |
| **Management**             | Provides resources, approves design outputs at key stages, and ensures alignment with organizational objectives.                                                                                      |

## **6. Procedure**

### **6.1 Design Planning**

* Determine stages of design and development appropriate for the product/service.
* Assign responsibilities and authorities.
* Define review, verification, and validation checkpoints.
* Reference the applicable Design Deliverables WI (WI-DC-001, WI-DC-002, or other approved WI).

### **6.2 Design Inputs**

* Capture functional, performance, statutory, and regulatory requirements.
* Review inputs for completeness and resolve conflicts.
* Document inputs in a controlled record (e.g., project plan, requirement specification).

### **6.3 Design Execution and Controls**

* Conduct design work according to the selected WI and mapped deliverables.
* Perform **design reviews** at defined stages, recording decisions and actions.
* Conduct **verification** to ensure outputs satisfy inputs.
* Conduct **validation** to ensure outputs meet intended use.
* Record all review, verification, and validation activities as controlled evidence.

### **6.4 Design Outputs**

* Ensure outputs meet input requirements, are clear for production or service delivery, and include acceptance criteria.
* Obtain approval from Design Owner and Management.
* Document outputs as controlled records.

### **6.5 Design Changes**

* Identify, review, approve, and document all design changes before implementation.
* Update all affected design outputs and records.
* For projects under QMS-SOP-07, changes may be documented via the project tracking tool (e.g., issues, pull requests) with linked approvals.

### **6.6 Records**

* Maintain all design inputs, outputs, reviews, verification, validation, and approved changes as controlled records.
* Acceptable records include: project plans, milestone logs, risk/opportunity registers, review minutes, validation and verification reports, lessons learned, and other artifacts produced via the selected SDLC framework or project management tool.

---

## **7. Integration with Project Management SOP**

* Design control activities may be executed through the organization’s project management process (QMS-SOP-07).
* Project milestones and review meetings may serve as design review, verification, and validation checkpoints.
* Design changes may be tracked using project tools, provided evidence is linked and approvals are documented.
* All project-managed artifacts used to meet SOP requirements are considered controlled records.
* Alternative WIs implementing other SDLC frameworks may also be used as long as all SOP requirements are satisfied.

## **8. Work Instructions**

| WI        | Purpose                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WI-DC-001 | Maps SOP design control activities to organizational default SDLC deliverables.         |
| WI-DC-002 | Maps SOP design control activities to alternative SDLC frameworks (e.g., Ontario SDLC). |
| WI-DC-003 | Optional future SDLC framework integration.                                             |

## **9. Review and Approval**

| Role         | Name | Signature | Date |
| ------------ | ---- | --------- | ---- |
| Design Owner |      |           |      |
| QA           |      |           |      |
| Management   |      |           |      |

### **10. Notes**

* SOP-DC-001 is framework-agnostic; work instructions implement the details of SDLC deliverables.
* The SOP ensures traceability, compliance, and auditable records regardless of project methodology.
* SOP can be extended to satisfy ISO 13485:2016 and IEC 62304 requirements by adding risk management and software-specific traceability in future WIs.
