## **6. Process Description**

### 6.1 Leadership Commitment

Leadership demonstrates commitment to the QMS by:

* Communicating the **Quality Policy**, vision, and strategy to all personnel.
* Integrating QMS requirements into daily workflows and strategic initiatives.
* Promoting risk-based thinking and continual improvement.
* Ensuring adequate resources for quality, technology, and people development.
* Supporting a culture that values **transparency, self-organization, and autonomy**.
* Taking accountability for the effectiveness of the QMS by reviewing key performance indicators (KPIs), audit results, and Management Review outputs.
* Ensuring QMS integrity is maintained during all planned or unplanned changes, in coordination with the **Change-Control-SOP**.

### 6.2 Customer Focus

* Ensure customer requirements are determined, understood, and met.
* Monitor customer satisfaction regularly and take corrective actions where required.

### 6.3 Quality Policy

* Establish a Quality Policy that is appropriate to the organization’s context and purpose.
* Ensure the policy is communicated, understood, and applied within the organization.
* Review the policy periodically for ongoing suitability.
* Verify communication and understanding of the Quality Policy during onboarding, internal audits, or periodic awareness checks.

### 6.4 Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities

* Define and communicate responsibilities and authorities throughout the organization.
* Assign a management representative (e.g., Quality Manager) to oversee the QMS.
* The Quality Manager shall report on QMS performance, opportunities for improvement, and customer focus trends to Top Management during Management Reviews.
* Responsibilities and authorities shall be reviewed and updated whenever organizational changes occur to ensure ongoing clarity and compliance.

### 6.5 Work Environment & Organizational Culture

Leadership fosters a **casual, dependency-based work culture** characterized by:

* **Egalitarian Collaboration** – Roles are respected but not hierarchical; decision-making is distributed based on expertise and relevance.
* **Autonomy and Mutual Trust** – Individuals and teams manage their own work commitments; leadership provides guidance and context, not control.
* **Dependency-Driven Execution** – Work proceeds when dependent tasks or conditions are satisfied, rather than on fixed timelines.
* **Low-Stress Productivity** – Emphasis is placed on focus, well-being, and quality of outcomes rather than time pressure.
* **Transparency** – All significant decisions, plans, and changes are visible and recorded to maintain shared understanding.
* **Continuous Feedback** – Feedback occurs naturally within workflows and during review cycles rather than through rigid performance intervals.

Leadership’s role is to **enable flow**, remove obstacles, and maintain clarity of purpose - not to manage by command or schedule.
Leadership also ensures that cultural and environmental conditions do not compromise the organization’s ability to meet customer, statutory, and regulatory requirements.
The effectiveness of this cultural approach shall be evaluated through employee feedback, performance trends, and Management Review discussions.
