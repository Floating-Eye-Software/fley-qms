## **6. Process Description**

### **6.1 Leadership Commitment**

Leadership demonstrates commitment to the QMS by:

* Communicating organizational purpose, strategic direction, and the Quality Policy.
* Ensuring QMS requirements are integrated into operational and strategic workflows.
* Promoting risk-based thinking and continual improvement.
* Ensuring adequate resources for technology, quality, training, and people development.
* Supporting a culture of transparency, autonomy, and responsible self-organization.
* Reviewing performance indicators, audit results, and Management Review outputs.
* Ensuring QMS integrity is maintained during planned and unplanned changes in accordance with the **Change Control SOP**.

### **6.2 Customer Focus**

Leadership ensures customer requirements are:

* Identified and understood
* Embedded into relevant processes
* Met through effective planning, resource management, and review

Customer satisfaction is monitored, and leadership ensures that concerns or trends are addressed.

### **6.3 Quality Policy**

Leadership ensures the Quality Policy is:

* Appropriate to the organization’s context and purpose
* Communicated, understood, and applied
* Maintained as a live statement of intent and direction
* Reviewed periodically for continued suitability

Understanding of the policy may be verified through onboarding activities, internal audits, or periodic check-ins.

### **6.4 Organizational Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities**

Leadership ensures that:

* Roles and responsibilities are defined, communicated, and understood.
* A management representative (Quality Manager) is assigned to oversee QMS performance.
* Responsibilities are updated as organizational or process changes occur.
* Authorities are granted in alignment with competency, responsibility, and process ownership.

The Quality Manager reports on QMS performance, risk and opportunity trends, and customer focus during Management Review.

### **6.5 Work Environment & Organizational Culture**

Leadership fosters a **casual, dependency-based work culture** that supports QMS effectiveness:

* **Egalitarian collaboration** — Decision-making is based on expertise and relevance, not hierarchy.
* **Autonomy & mutual trust** — Teams manage their commitments; leadership provides context and enables flow.
* **Dependency-driven execution** — Work progresses when preconditions are met, ensuring natural prioritization.
* **Low-stress productivity** — Focus and well-being support high-quality outcomes.
* **Transparency** — Plans, decisions, and changes are visible, traceable, and recorded.
* **Continuous feedback** — Feedback occurs within normal workflows and during review cycles, not on rigid schedules.

Leadership ensures that this cultural approach supports - not compromises - the fulfillment of customer, statutory, and regulatory requirements.

Effectiveness of cultural conditions is assessed through:

* Employee feedback
* Performance and quality indicators
* Management Review discussions
