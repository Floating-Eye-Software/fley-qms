   * User feedback and complaints
   * App store reviews
   * Academic research and peer-reviewed studies
   * Media reports and public awareness campaigns
   * Regulatory alerts (Health Canada, FDA, EU MDR, etc.)
2. Assign each item a **unique PMS ID**.

### 6.2 Documentation

   * Assigned owner and review date
   * Status / action plan

### 6.3 Evaluation

1. Evaluate each PMS item for:

   * **Safety or privacy risk** → update RMF and mitigation plan
   * **New design input or user need** → propose SRS update
   * **Regulatory requirement** → update QMS procedure or documentation
2. Document the evaluation outcome and decision in the PMS log.

### 6.4 Action / Mitigation

1. Implement corrective or preventive actions as required:

   * Update app features, functionality, or user interface
   * Update SRS and RMF
