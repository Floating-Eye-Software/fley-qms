# **4. Definitions**

| Term                            | Definition                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Risk**                        | A potential *negative* effect of uncertainty. Risks may affect quality, service conformity, reliability, performance, compliance, or continuity.               |
| **Opportunity**                 | A potential *positive* effect of uncertainty that may lead to improvement if realized.                                                                         |
| **Improvement**                 | A planned and intentional positive change. If an opportunity is approved for implementation, it becomes an Improvement and follows the Change Control process. |
| **Tracked Item / Issue**        | A record used to document a risk or an opportunity in the QMS repository or tracking system.                                                                   |
| **Risk & Opportunity Register** | The controlled list of all active risk and opportunity records.                                                                                                |
| **Risk Level**                  | A qualitative evaluation of *severity × likelihood* (low/medium/high).                                                                                         |

| **Top Management**      | Promote risk-based thinking; review significant risks/opportunities; approve major actions.                                                      | Approve actions affecting QMS strategy or major process changes.   |
| **Quality Manager**     | Maintain the Risk & Opportunity Register; ensure evaluations are appropriate; monitor action effectiveness; escalate as needed.                  | Approve risk assessment methodology and related QMS documentation. |
| **Process Owners**      | Identify risks/opportunities in their processes; perform evaluations; propose and implement mitigation or enhancement actions; maintain records. | Approve and implement actions within their processes.              |
| **All Employees**       | Report new risks; suggest opportunities; support mitigation or improvement activities as assigned.                                               | Request escalation or review of risk concerns.                     |

# **6. Process Description**

## **6.1 Identification of Risks and Opportunities**

Risks and opportunities may be identified from:

* Internal audits
* Nonconformances or CAPA activities
* Customer complaints or feedback
* Supplier evaluation or monitoring
* Process performance trends
* New tools, technologies, or infrastructure changes
* Strategic planning and project planning
* Staff suggestions and observations
* Management Review

### **Recording Method**

Each risk or opportunity must be recorded as a **Tracked Item / Issue** in the QMS repository, including:

1. Title
2. Description and context
3. Potential impact
4. Initial evaluation
5. Links to related processes, records, or issues
6. Assigned owner

All active items collectively form the **Risk & Opportunity Register**.

---

## **6.2 Evaluation of Risks**

Each risk is qualitatively evaluated based on:

* **Severity** — Low / Medium / High
* **Likelihood** — Low / Medium / High

Risks rated as **High** in either dimension require:

* Documented mitigation
* Monitoring
* Review during Management Review

Numerical scoring is optional and not required.

---

## **6.3 Risk Treatment**

When addressing risks, the following response types may be used:

* **Mitigate** — Reduce likelihood or severity
* **Avoid** — Modify processes to remove the risk entirely
* **Transfer** — Externalize exposure (e.g., outsourcing, contracts)
* **Accept** — Document decision to accept low or manageable risks

Mitigation actions may be documented:

* Within the same risk record
* As part of Change Control (if the action requires a process change)
* In the Action Tracker (if assigned through Management Review or planning)

---

## **6.4 Opportunity Identification & Evaluation**

### **6.4.1 Definition of Opportunities**

Opportunities include possible improvements such as:

* Increased automation or efficiency
* Improved quality or consistency
* More reliable or resilient processes
* Reduced burden or complexity
* Enhanced documentation or traceability
* Better use of available tools and technology

### **6.4.2 Evaluation**

Each opportunity is evaluated using lightweight criteria:

1. **Potential Benefit**
2. **Feasibility**
3. **Effort Required**

Associated risks may be captured if relevant but are not required.

---

## **6.5 Opportunity Decisions**

### **Option A: Not Pursued → Opportunity Closed**

Reasons may include:

* Insufficient benefit
* Not feasible
* Not aligned with strategy
* Excessive effort for expected value

Closing an opportunity is **not** a nonconformance.

### **Option B: Pursued → Converts to an Improvement**

If approved:

1. The opportunity record is linked to a new **Improvement** record.
2. The improvement follows the **Change Control SOP**.
3. The opportunity record is closed with a note indicating approval and cross-reference.

This ensures clear separation between **uncertain ideas** and **approved changes**.

---

## **6.6 Monitoring and Review**

The Quality Manager and Process Owners must monitor:

* Status of mitigation or enhancement actions
* Changing relevance of risks/opportunities
* New emerging items from feedback, audits, or changes

Effectiveness is reviewed during:

* Internal Audits
* Process performance reviews
* Management Review

Results are documented in the Risk & Opportunity Register.
