### **6. Procedure**

#### **6.1 Identification of Risks and Opportunities**

Risks and opportunities may be identified through:

* Analysis of internal and external issues (Context of the Organization, Clause 4.1)
* Interested party needs and expectations (Clause 4.2)
* Process mapping and FMEA-style reviews
* Customer feedback, audits, and management reviews
* Nonconformities, complaints, and corrective actions
* Change proposals or new projects

Each risk or opportunity shall be recorded in the **Risk & Opportunity Register** or equivalent tool (e.g., GitHub Issues labeled “Risk” / “Opportunity,” Confluence risk table, or Excel log).

---

#### **6.2 Risk Assessment**

1. Evaluate each risk using a consistent method, such as **Likelihood × Impact** or a qualitative rating (Low / Medium / High).
2. Prioritize risks based on their significance to:

   * Product or service conformity
   * Customer satisfaction
   * Legal or regulatory compliance
   * QMS effectiveness
3. Opportunities may be rated similarly, emphasizing potential improvement impact and feasibility.

---

#### **6.3 Planning Actions**

For each significant risk or opportunity:

1. Define **mitigation or enhancement actions**, responsible person, and timeline.
2. Integrate these actions into relevant processes or projects (e.g., project plan, process improvement).
3. Where applicable, link to:

   * **Change Control SOP** for process changes
   * **Project Management SOP** for implementation
   * **Quality Objectives** for performance monitoring

---

#### **6.4 Implementation and Monitoring**

* Process owners implement assigned actions and update status in the Risk & Opportunity Register.
* The Quality Manager monitors progress and verifies implementation.
* Actions shall be evaluated for **effectiveness**, typically during:

  * Management Reviews
  * Internal Audits
  * Process performance evaluations

---

#### **6.5 Review and Continuous Improvement**

1. **Periodic Review:** At least annually (or during Management Review), assess the status of significant risks and opportunities.
2. **Emerging Risks:** Add new risks as they arise from changes, audits, or feedback.
3. **Learning:** Incorporate lessons learned from completed actions into QMS improvement initiatives.

The outcome of risk and opportunity reviews shall feed into the **Planning** and **Leadership** processes.

The status and effectiveness of significant risk and opportunity actions shall be reviewed during Management Review meetings per the *Management-Review-SOP*.
