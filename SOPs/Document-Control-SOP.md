#### 5.1 Creation and Updating

When creating or updating documented information, ensure:

1. **Identification and Description:** Include title, date, author, reference number, or other identifiers.
2. **Format and Media:** Specify language, software version, graphics, or media type (paper, electronic, etc.). Acceptable electronic formats include PDF, DOCX, XLSX, digital forms, databases, or controlled repositories (e.g., SharePoint, GitHub, document control software).
3. **Review and Approval:** Documented information must be reviewed and approved for suitability and adequacy prior to release. Electronic approvals (digital signatures, workflow approvals, or authenticated logins) are acceptable when traceable to the responsible individual.

#### 5.2 Control of Documented Information

Documented information shall be controlled to ensure it is available where and when needed and protected against loss or unauthorized use.

The following activities shall be addressed as applicable:

1. **Distribution, Access, Retrieval, and Use:** Ensure appropriate access and authority to view or modify information.
2. **Storage and Preservation:** Protect documented information from damage, deterioration, or loss, preserving legibility and integrity.
3. **Control of Changes:** Maintain version control to prevent unintended alterations.
4. **Retention and Disposition:** Retain documented information as required and dispose of it appropriately when no longer needed.

#### 5.3 External Documented Information

Documented information from external sources required for planning or operation of the QMS shall be identified and controlled in the same manner as internal documents.

#### 5.4 System Requirements for Electronic Control

* The system used for electronic document control shall:
  * Provide authentication (unique login IDs, passwords, or SSO)
  * Prevent unauthorized access or modification
  * Maintain audit trails for creation, modification, approval, and deletion
  * Support electronic signatures or workflow approvals traceable to individuals
  * Be periodically backed up and validated for functionality and data integrity
* When operating under regulatory control (e.g., FDA, EU GMP), the system must also comply with **21 CFR Part 11** or **EU Annex 11** requirements.
