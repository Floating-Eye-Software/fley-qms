## **1. Purpose**

To ensure that all Quality Management System (QMS) documents and records are created, reviewed, approved, distributed, and maintained in a controlled manner that preserves their accuracy, integrity, and availability throughout their lifecycle.

This procedure defines how current, authorized versions are made available to users, how historical versions remain traceable, and how obsolete information is prevented from unintended use.

---

## **2. Scope**

This SOP applies to **all documented information** within the QMS, including:

* **Controlled documents** — procedures, work instructions, templates, policies, and controlled forms.
* **Records** — logs, registers, the Master Planning Log (MPL), CAPA log, Risk Register, and other factual evidence of QMS activities.
* All systems, repositories, or media used to create, maintain, or publish QMS information.

## **3. References**

* ISO 9001:2015 — Clauses 7.5.2, 7.5.3
* ISO 13485:2016 — Clauses 4.2.4, 4.2.5

## **4. Definitions**

| Term                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Controlled Document**    | A formally reviewed, approved, and version-controlled document made available for operational use within the QMS. Examples include SOPs, WIs, templates, and policies. |
| **Record**                 | Factual evidence of QMS activities or results. Records are maintained for traceability and compliance (e.g., logs, registers, forms, meeting minutes).                 |
| **Documented Information** | A collective term referring to both controlled documents and records as defined in ISO 9001:2015 Clause 7.5.                                                           |
| **Slug**                   | A standardized identifier for each controlled document, typically combining type and title (e.g., `SOP_Document-Control`).                                             |
| **Revision (`r#`)**        | The controlled, approved iteration of a document. Each approved revision supersedes the prior one.                                                                     |
| **Controlled Source**      | The authoritative publication location for the current approved revision (e.g., QMS document repository, official wiki, or dedicated platform).                        |

## **5. Resources**

This process requires:

* A document control system or repository
* Approved document templates
* Defined approval and change control workflows
* Access controls for publication and maintenance
* Personnel trained in document control procedures

## **7. Process Description**

### **7.1 Document Creation and Approval**

1. Controlled documents are authored using approved templates and structure.
2. Each document must include:

   * Title
   * Revision identifier (`r#`)
   * Controlled Source link
   * Unique slug for identification
3. Documents undergo formal review and approval per the **Change Control SOP**.
4. Once approved, the document is published to the controlled source and made available for use.
5. The published version represents the **current approved revision**.

---

### **7.2 Review and Revision**

1. Controlled documents are reviewed:

   * At planned intervals (e.g., every two years), or
   * Whenever a process, regulatory, or organizational change occurs.
2. Updates follow the **Change Control SOP**.
3. Each approved revision is assigned a new **revision number** and published as the active version.
4. Superseded revisions are archived for traceability.

---

### **7.3 Control of Records**

1. Records provide **objective evidence** of QMS implementation.
2. Process Owners maintain records in their designated controlled areas.
3. Each record should include, where applicable:

   * Date of entry or completion
   * Responsible person
   * Reference to related activities, issues, or changes
4. Records are reviewed periodically to ensure completeness and accuracy.
5. Records are retained as part of the permanent QMS history and are protected from alteration or loss.

---

### **7.4 Identification and Status**

1. Controlled documents include in their header:

   * Title
   * Revision identifier (`r#`)
   * Controlled Source link
2. Users confirm document validity by verifying that it is published in the **controlled source** or designated system of record.
3. Approval and change metadata are maintained in the document control system; they do not need to appear directly in the document body.

---

### **7.5 Control of Obsolete Documents**

1. When a new revision is approved, the previous revision becomes **obsolete**.
2. Obsolete documents remain available for reference but are clearly identified as superseded.
3. Only the current approved revision is made available for operational use.
4. Records are not considered obsolete; they remain part of the QMS evidence base.

---

### **7.6 Availability and Access**

1. The controlled source serves as the **single source of truth** for all approved QMS documents.
2. All personnel have read access to controlled documents.
3. Editing rights are restricted to authorized roles.
4. Access and configuration controls ensure document integrity, authenticity, and traceability.
