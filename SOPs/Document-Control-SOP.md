## **5. Procedure**

### **5.1 Creation and Approval of Documents**

1. New documents shall be authored by the responsible Process Owner or delegate.
2. Each new document shall:

   * Use the approved template and metadata header.
   * Be assigned a unique **slug** (see Section 5.6).
   * Be submitted via a GitHub Pull Request (PR) for review and approval.
3. Documents must be **reviewed and approved** prior to merging to the `main` branch.

   * Approval is provided through GitHub PR approval.
   * The merged and tagged revision represents the official approved document.

---

### **5.2 Review and Revision**

1. Controlled documents shall be reviewed periodicallyâ€”typically every two yearsâ€”or sooner if a change in process, regulation, or requirement occurs.
2. Revisions are proposed via Pull Request in accordance with the **Change Control SOP**.
3. Upon approval and merge, a new Git tag shall be created to identify the approved revision, using the format:

   ```
   SOP_Document-Control_r2
   ```

   where the **slug** identifies the document and the **r#** identifies the approved revision.

---

### **5.3 Control of Obsolete Documents**

1. Superseded or obsolete revisions remain in the repositoryâ€™s history but are not accessible as the default revision.
2. Obsolete documents may be moved to an `/archive/` directory or clearly marked as **OBSOLETE** in the file header.
3. Only the **main branch** and latest Git tag represent current, controlled revisions.

---

### **5.4 Availability and Access**

1. Approved documents are available in read-only form through the GitHub repository or published GitHub Pages site.
2. Editing rights are restricted to authorized personnel with designated access.
3. Public or internal read access is determined by management and repository settings.

---

### **5.5 Control of External Documents**

Documents of external origin that are necessary for the QMS (e.g., standards, supplier manuals) shall be:

* Listed in an external document register or referenced within applicable SOPs.
* Verified as current and relevant.
* Stored or linked within the controlled repository or document management system.

---

### **5.6 Document Identification**

1. Each controlled document shall have a **unique slug** constructed as:

   ```
   [Type]_[Descriptive-Title]
   ```

   Examples:

   * `SOP_Document-Control.md`
   * `WI_Pull-Request-Workflow.md`
   * `TPL_Corrective-Action-Form.md`
2. The document header shall include the following metadata fields:

   ```markdown
   # SOP â€“ Document Control  
   **Revision:** r2  
   **Effective Date:** 2025-10-12  
   **Approved By:** [Name / Title]  
   **Controlled Source:** https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/SOPs/SOP_Document-Control.md  
   ```
3. **Revisions** are identified using the `r#` notation, matching the Git tag (e.g., `SOP_Document-Control_r2`).
4. The **GitHub repository** and associated **Git tags** constitute the single source of truth for document identification and revision history.
