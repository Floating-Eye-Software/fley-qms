# ðŸ§¾ **SOP: Document Control**

**Effective Date:** [To be assigned]
**Revision:** r3
**Title:** Document Control
**Controlled Source:** [GitHub Repository URL]

---

## **1. Purpose**

To ensure all QMS documents and records are identified, maintained, and controlled so that:

* Only current, authorized revisions of controlled documents are used.
* Records accurately capture what has occurred in the QMS and remain auditable.
* Obsolete or draft material is not used unintentionally.

---

## **2. Scope**

Applies to **all documented information** within the QMS, including:

* Controlled documents: SOPs, WIs, templates, policies
* Records: logs, registers, the Master Planning Log (MPL), CAPA log, Risk Register
* All repositories, systems, and locations where such documents or records are created, stored, or used

> **Note:** Controlled documents require formal approval and revision control.
> Records are maintained in a structured, version-controlled system (e.g., Git) and updated by process owners without formal approval for each entry, but are subject to traceability, integrity, and periodic review.

## **5. Procedure**

### **5.1 Creation and Approval of Controlled Documents**

1. Authoring is done by Process Owners or delegates.
2. Each document must:

   * Use an approved template and header
   * Have a unique **slug**
   * Be submitted via GitHub Pull Request (PR) for review and approval
3. Approved PRs are merged to `main` and tagged; this constitutes the official revision.

---

### **5.2 Review and Revision of Controlled Documents**

1. Periodic review (typically every two years) or upon regulatory/process change.
2. Revision proposed via PR per **Change Control SOP**.
3. Approved revisions tagged with the format:

   ```
   SOP_Document-Control_r3
   ```

---

### **5.3 Control of Records (MPL, CAPA Log, Risk Register, etc.)**

1. Records **document what has happened**, not what should happen.
2. **Updates are made by process owners** or designated personnel in real time.
3. Records must include:

   * Date of entry
   * Responsible owner
   * Links to related GitHub Issues, PRs, or Milestones
4. Records are **version-controlled** via Git and/or stored in the QMS Wiki.
5. Records are **reviewed periodically** (quarterly) for completeness, integrity, and alignment with Management Review.
6. Historical entries are **never deleted**; audit trails are preserved automatically by Git.

---

### **5.4 Control of Obsolete Documents**

1. Superseded or obsolete controlled documents remain in Git history but are not the default version.
2. Obsolete documents may be archived or marked `OBSOLETE`.
3. Records are never considered obsolete; they remain accessible for audit and traceability.

---

### **5.5 Availability and Access**

1. Controlled documents are available in read-only form to all relevant personnel.
2. Editing privileges are restricted to authorized personnel.
3. Records are updated in their structured repository by assigned owners.
4. Access permissions in GitHub ensure integrity and traceability.

---

### **5.6 Document Identification**

1. Controlled documents have a **slug**: `[Type]_[Descriptive-Title]`
   Examples:

   * `SOP_Document-Control.md`
   * `WI_Pull-Request-Workflow.md`
   * `TPL_Corrective-Action-Form.md`
2. Header metadata includes:

   ```markdown
   # SOP â€“ Document Control  
   **Revision:** r3  
   **Effective Date:** 2025-10-14  
   **Approved By:** [Name / Title]  
   **Controlled Source:** https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/SOPs/SOP_Document-Control.md
   ```
3. **Revisions** identified by `r#` and Git tag.
