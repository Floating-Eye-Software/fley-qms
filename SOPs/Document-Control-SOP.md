### **5. Procedure**

#### **5.1 Creation and Approval of Documents**

1. New documents shall be authored by the responsible Process Owner or delegate.
2. Each new document shall:

   * Use the approved template and metadata header.
   * Be assigned a document number and title according to Section 5.6.
   * Be submitted via GitHub Pull Request for review and approval.
3. Documents must be **reviewed and approved** prior to merging to the main branch.

   * Approval is provided via GitHub Pull Request (PR) approval feature.
   * The merged and tagged version represents the official approved document.

---

#### **5.2 Review and Revision**

1. Controlled documents shall be reviewed periodically, typically every two years, or sooner if a change in process or requirement occurs.
2. Revisions are proposed via Pull Request in accordance with the **Change Control SOP**.
3. Upon approval and merge, a new Git tag (e.g., `SOP-003_r2`) shall be created to identify the approved revision.

---

#### **5.3 Control of Obsolete Documents**

1. Superseded or obsolete versions shall be retained in the repositoryâ€™s history but not accessible as the default version.
2. Obsolete documents may be moved to an `/archive/` directory or clearly marked as **OBSOLETE** in the file header.
3. Only the **main branch** and latest Git tag represent current, controlled versions.

---

#### **5.4 Availability and Access**

1. Approved documents are available in read-only form through the GitHub repository or published GitHub Pages site.
2. Editing rights are restricted to authorized personnel with designated access.
3. Public or internal read access is determined by management and repository settings.

---

#### **5.5 Control of External Documents**

Documents of external origin that are necessary for the QMS (e.g., standards, supplier manuals) shall be:

* Listed in an external document register or referenced within applicable SOPs.
* Verified as current and relevant.
* Stored or linked in the controlled repository or management system.

---

#### **5.6 Document Identification and Numbering**

1. Each controlled document shall have a **unique identifier** consisting of:

   * **Prefix:** Document type (SOP, WI, TPL, POL, REC)
   * **Sequential Number:** Three-digit, incrementing identifier (e.g., `SOP-003`)
   * **Title:** Short, descriptive name separated by underscores.
   * Example filename:

     ```
     SOP-003_Document-Control.md
     ```

2. The document header shall include the following metadata fields:

   ```markdown
   # SOP-003 â€“ Document Control  
   **Revision:** r1  
   **Effective Date:** 2025-10-11  
   **Approved By:** [Name / Title]  
   **Controlled Source:** https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/SOPs/SOP-003_Document-Control.md  
   ```

3. **Revisions** are identified using `r#` notation, matching the Git tag (e.g., `SOP-003_r1`).

4. The **GitHub repository** and associated **Git tags** constitute the single source of truth for document identification and revision history.
