## **5. Procedure**

### **5.1 Project Initiation**

1. Define project purpose, objectives, scope, and deliverables.
2. Assign a Project Manager and core team.
3. Conduct an initial **risk and opportunity assessment** per QMS-SOP-08.
4. Determine applicable QMS SOPs and required planning templates:

   * **Project Plan Template** (baseline schedule, milestones, communication).
   * **Project Quality Plan (PQP)** (quality, risk, and compliance structure).
   * **Design Control Plan (DCP)** (if design/development project).
5. Obtain top management approval before proceeding.

### **5.2 Project Planning**

1. Develop the **Project Plan**:

   * Tasks, milestones, and responsibilities.
   * Dependencies and schedule.
   * Resource allocation and communication plan.
2. Complete the **Project Quality Plan (PQP)**:

   * Quality objectives, risk management, training, configuration, and verification.
   * Reference to **QMS-SOP-08** for risk control.
   * Identify deliverables per project type (Full / Mini).
3. For design projects, integrate or attach the **Design Control Plan (DCP)**.

### **5.3 Project Execution and Monitoring**

1. Track task completion, risks, and deliverables in the project tracking tool.
2. Hold **regular review meetings** (weekly, biweekly, or at stage gates).
3. Update risk status and link to mitigation actions in the register.
4. Record design or process changes using **QMS-SOP-02 Change Control**.
5. Ensure QMS records (plans, reviews, test results) are current and auditable.

---

### **5.4 Project Reviews and Controls**

* Conduct formal reviews at key milestones:

  * Project initiation
  * Midpoint / phase completion
  * Design reviews (if applicable)
  * Project closure
* Document review findings and improvement actions.
* Update the PQP with any changes in risks, scope, or schedule.

### **5.5 Project Closure**

1. Verify that all deliverables have been completed and accepted.
2. Confirm that all risks and CAPAs are closed or transferred to ongoing monitoring.
3. Capture **lessons learned** and improvement opportunities.
4. Archive all project records in the QMS repository.
5. Update the management review inputs with key outcomes.
