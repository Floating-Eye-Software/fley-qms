### **4. Procedure**

#### 4.1 Project Initiation

1. Define project objectives, scope, deliverables, and success criteria.
2. Identify key stakeholders and responsible personnel.
3. Conduct preliminary risk and opportunity assessment (link to QMS risk register).
4. Determine required resources, timeline, and milestones.

#### 4.2 Project Planning

1. Develop a project plan that includes:

   * Task list and responsibilities.
   * Milestones for key deliverables or decision points.
   * Risk mitigation and opportunity capture activities.
   * Communication and reporting plan.
2. Determine the **project tracking method** (e.g., Kanban board, Gantt chart, task tracker).
3. Link project objectives to QMS objectives when applicable.

#### 4.3 Project Execution and Monitoring

1. Assign tasks to responsible team members and update progress regularly.
2. Track risks, opportunities, objectives, and changes in the chosen tool.
3. Hold periodic project review meetings to assess:

   * Progress toward milestones.
   * Effectiveness of risk mitigation and opportunities realized.
   * Resource allocation.
   * Alignment with QMS requirements.
4. Update project documentation and ensure evidence of compliance is recorded.

#### 4.4 Project Review & Control

1. Review project performance at defined milestones and adjust plans as necessary.
2. Document lessons learned and improvement opportunities.
3. Escalate major deviations to top management for decision-making.

#### 4.5 Project Closure

1. Confirm that all deliverables have been completed and accepted.
2. Ensure all risks, objectives, and actions have been addressed or handed over to ongoing QMS processes.
3. Document lessons learned, including process improvements for future projects.
4. Close the project in the tracking tool (Kanban board, repository, or equivalent).

### **5. Integration with the QMS**

* Project activities must comply with relevant QMS SOPs:

  * **Planning SOP (QMS-SOP-06)** â€“ risk, opportunity, and objective management.
  * **Leadership SOP (QMS-SOP-05)** â€“ top management oversight and context monitoring.
* **WI-QMS-09-01** may be referenced for tool-specific execution (e.g., using GitHub Issues and boards).

---

### **6. Records**

* Project plan and timeline documents.
* Project task tracking and progress reports.
* Risk & Opportunity documentation linked to QMS risk register.
* Meeting notes and management review evidence.
* Lessons learned and improvement records.

---

### **7. References**

* ISO 9001:2015 Clauses 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
* QMS-SOP-05 Leadership
* QMS-SOP-06 Planning
* WI-QMS-09-01 Operating the QMS in GitHub

---

ðŸ’¡ **Key Notes:**

* This SOP is **tool-agnostic** â€” you can use Kanban, Gantt, spreadsheets, or any project management software.
* Milestones are recommended for **temporary projects** (QMS implementation, product development) but not for ongoing operational activities.
* Recurring tasks (e.g., monitoring objectives, updating context, internal audits) are part of QMS operation, not individual projects.
