---

## **2. Scope**

This procedure applies to all planning activities related to the QMS, including:

* Risk and opportunity management
* Establishment and monitoring of quality objectives
* Planning and controlling changes
* Planning activities associated with projects, processes, or improvements that may affect product/service conformity or customer satisfaction

Platform-specific workflows, templates, and execution methods are documented separately in Work Instructions (WIs).

## **6. Procedure**

### **6.1 General Planning Requirements**

Planning shall ensure that:

1. The QMS remains suitable, adequate, and effective.
2. Plans consider relevant inputs, including:
   * Applicable requirements (statutory, regulatory, customer)
   * Context of the organization and needs of interested parties
   * Risks and opportunities
   * Results of audits, performance data, and Management Review
   * Resource needs and constraints
3. Planning outputs include:
   * Defined actions
   * Assigned responsibilities and authorities
   * Required resources
   * Success criteria or acceptance metrics
   * Expected timelines or conditions for completion
4. Planning activities maintain traceability between:
   * Objectives
   * Risks and opportunities
   * Actions
   * Changes
   * Verification and effectiveness results
5. Platform-specific execution methods (issue types, fields, milestones, workflows, etc.) are defined in Work Instructions.

Planning is required when:

* Establishing or revising quality objectives
* Implementing new or changed processes or capabilities
* Addressing significant risks or opportunities
* Making significant changes to the QMS
* Initiating projects or improvements that may affect conformity or customer satisfaction

### **6.2 Risks and Opportunities**

* Risks and opportunities shall be identified from:

  * Context of the organization
  * Feedback from interested parties
  * Audit results, process performance data, and Management Review inputs

* Identified risks/opportunities shall be evaluated for significance and prioritized.
* Actions shall be determined, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness.
* Records shall be maintained in the Risk & Opportunity Register.
* Actions shall be integrated into relevant Plans or QMS processes.
* Effectiveness shall be evaluated in internal audits and Management Reviews.

### **6.3 Quality Objectives**

Quality objectives shall be:

* Consistent with the Quality Policy
* Measurable and monitored
* Communicated and updated as necessary
* Established considering statutory, regulatory, and customer requirements
* Documented with assigned responsibility, required resources, and target conditions

Progress toward objectives shall be monitored and evaluated during Management Reviews and through performance metrics defined in the Quality Objectives Register.

### **6.4 Planning Changes**

When significant changes to the QMS are required, planning shall consider:

* Purpose of the change
* Potential consequences
* Required resources
* Responsibilities and authorities
* Impact on the integrity of the QMS

Changes shall be documented and reviewed for effectiveness per the Change Control SOP.

### **6.5 Execution of Planning Activities**

During execution:

* Actions, deliverables, and results shall be recorded in accordance with the governing Plan.
* Risks and opportunities shall be updated and linked to their associated actions.
* Changes shall be recorded per the Change Control SOP.
* Records generated from planning (objectives, actions taken, evidence of completion) shall remain current and auditable.

### **6.6 Verification of Effectiveness**

Verification confirms that planning activities achieved their intended results and that the QMS remains effective.

Process / Project Owners shall:

* Verify completion or disposition of all planned actions.
* Assess implementation results against defined objectives and success criteria.
* Record verification results and supporting evidence in the governing Plan.
* Capture residual risks, improvement opportunities, or lessons learned.

#### **6.6.1 Effectiveness Outcomes**
