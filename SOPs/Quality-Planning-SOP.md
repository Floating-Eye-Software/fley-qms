### **6. Procedure**

6.1 **Risks and Opportunities**

* Risks and opportunities shall be identified from:

  * Context of the organization (Clause 4)
  * Feedback from interested parties
  * Audit results, process performance data, and management review inputs
* Identified risks/opportunities shall be evaluated for significance and prioritized.
* Actions shall be determined, implemented, and monitored for effectiveness.
* Records shall be maintained in a structured register (see related WI).

6.2 **Quality Objectives**

* Quality objectives shall be:

  * Consistent with the Quality Policy
  * Measurable and monitored
  * Communicated and updated as necessary
* Progress toward objectives shall be reviewed during Management Review.

Progress toward quality objectives shall be reviewed during Management Review meetings per *Management-Review-SOP*.

6.3 **Planning Changes**

* When significant changes to the QMS are required, the following shall be considered:

  * Purpose of the change
  * Potential consequences
  * Resource requirements
  * Responsibilities and authorities
* Changes shall be documented and reviewed for effectiveness.

Results and decisions from Management Reviews may initiate planned changes to the QMS, implemented per the *Change-Control-SOP*.

6.4 **Quality Planning Execution**

* Track task completion and deliverables in the project tracking tool.
* Update risk status and link to mitigation actions in the register.
* Record design or process changes using **Change Control SOP**.
* Ensure QMS records (objectives, action results) are current and auditable.

Effectiveness of executed actions shall be reviewed during Management Review meetings per *Management-Review-SOP*.

6.5 **Verification of Effectiveness**

Verification of effectiveness confirms that planned quality activities have achieved their intended results and that the QMS remains suitable, adequate, and effective.

The responsible **Process Owner** or **Project Owner** shall:

* Verify that all deliverables, planned actions, and milestones under the Plan or Project have been completed or appropriately dispositioned.  
* Assess implementation results against defined **objectives, success criteria, and acceptance metrics** in the approved Plan.  
* Record the verification summary, results, and supporting evidence within the governing Plan or associated Issues.  
* Capture any residual risks, improvement opportunities, or lessons learned to inform future planning activities.  

**Effectiveness Outcomes:**

| **Assessment** | **Definition** | **Required Follow-up** |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Effective** | All planned objectives were achieved and controls function as intended. | Close the Plan or Project. No further action required beyond routine monitoring. |
| **Partially Effective** | Objectives were met in principle, but one or more controls did not operate as intended or cannot yet be fully verified. | Create or link an Issue in the QMS repository to document the limitation, residual risk, or improvement action. Track the issue until resolution, re-verify effectiveness after the issue has been addressed, and include the results in the next Management Review. |
| **Ineffective** | Objectives were not achieved or the implemented controls failed to ensure conformity or intended performance. | Escalate to Top Management. Open an Issue in the QMS repository to document the failure, identify root cause, and define corrective action per the **Corrective and Preventive Action SOP**. Effectiveness shall be re-verified after corrective measures are implemented. |

Verification outcomes and any related Issues shall be referenced in Management Review inputs and retained as controlled records.
