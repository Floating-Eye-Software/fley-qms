# ðŸ“˜ Project & Quality Planning SOP (Draft)

## **1. Purpose**
This SOP establishes the process for planning and executing both projects and quality activities across Floating Eye Software (FLEY). It ensures that all work is structured, resourced, and controlled in compliance with:

* 21 CFR 820.20(d) â€“ Quality Planning  
* 21 CFR 820.30(b) â€“ Design and Development Planning  
* ISO 13485:2016, Clauses 5.4.2, 7.1, and 7.3.2  

---

## **2. Scope**
* Applies to both:
  - **Project planning** for all organizational projects.  
  - **Quality planning** at both the organization level (continuous improvement, audits) and project level (design and development).  
* Applies to the planning, monitoring, and closure of projects and quality initiatives.  
* The specific tools and platforms used to execute this SOP are defined in **Work Instructions (WIs)**.  

---

## **3. Responsibilities**
* **Quality Manager / QMS Owner**: Maintains this SOP; reviews and approves all quality plans.  
* **Project Managers**: Create project plans and ensure alignment with quality plans.  
* **Compliance Officer**: Ensures GDPR and regulatory requirements are addressed.  
* **All Team Members**: Follow approved plans, record evidence of execution.
