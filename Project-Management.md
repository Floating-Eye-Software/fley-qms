# Red Witch Project Management

## Introduction

Red Witch utilizes GitHub's suite of project management tools to streamline collaboration, version control, documentation, and automation. This procedure outlines best practices for leveraging various GitHub components to effectively manage the Red Witch project.

## Code

### GitHub Repository

- All project source code, documentation, and assets are stored in GitHub repositories.
- Each major component of the project has its own repository to facilitate organization and modularity.

#### Key Practices
- **Repository Structure**: Maintain a clear and consistent structure within repositories for easy navigation and access to project assets.
- **Branching Strategy**: Utilize a branching strategy such as GitFlow to manage development and release cycles efficiently.
- **Commit Messages**: Enforce clear and descriptive commit messages to document changes effectively and ensure traceability.

## Issues

### GitHub Issues

- GitHub Issues are used for tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests, ensuring transparency and accountability.

#### Key Practices
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions for each issue, including steps to reproduce and expected behavior.
- **Assignment and Labels**: Assign issues to team members and categorize them using appropriate labels.
- **Linking**: Link issues to related pull requests, project boards, and milestones for traceability.

## Pull Requests

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- Pull Requests facilitate code review and quality control, allowing for proposed changes to be discussed before merging into the main branch.

#### Key Practices
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate CI tools like GitHub Actions to automate testing and checks on each PR.
- **Merge Policies**: Define merge policies, requiring a successful build and passing tests before merging code changes.

## Discussions

### GitHub Discussions

- GitHub Discussions foster open-ended conversations and community engagement, facilitating collaboration and idea exchange.

#### Key Practices
- **Community Engagement**: Encourage stakeholders and contributors to participate in discussions, sharing insights and feedback.
- **Idea Generation**: Use discussions to generate new ideas, gather feedback, and make decisions collaboratively.

## Actions

### GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions automate workflows, such as testing and deployment, improving efficiency and consistency.

#### Key Practices
- **Automated Testing**: Set up automated testing to run on each commit and PR, detecting issues early in the development cycle.
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Configure deployment pipelines to automate the deployment process to various environments (e.g., staging, production).
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting within workflows to quickly identify and address issues in production.

## Projects

### GitHub Projects

- GitHub Projects provide Kanban-style boards for managing tasks and workflow, enabling efficient project tracking and progress visualization.

#### Key Practices
- **Kanban Boards**: Utilize Kanban boards within GitHub Projects to visualize tasks and their progress through different stages.
- **Milestones**: Define milestones for major deliverables, tracking progress towards key project goals.
- **Labels**: Categorize tasks using labels (e.g., bug, enhancement, high priority) to facilitate organization and prioritization.

## Wiki

### GitHub Wiki

- GitHub Wikis serve as a central repository for project documentation, including design documents, user guides, and FAQs.

#### Key Practices
- **Structured Documentation**: Organize the Wiki with clear sections, ensuring easy navigation and access to relevant information.
- **Versioning**: Maintain version control for documentation, updating it regularly to reflect project developments.

## Security

### GitHub's Security Features

- Utilize GitHub's security features, such as vulnerability scanning and dependency analysis, to protect the project and ensure compliance with relevant standards.

#### Key Practices
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and address security vulnerabilities to mitigate potential risks.
- **Security Scanning**: Enable security scanning tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the codebase proactively.

## Insights

### GitHub Insights

- GitHub Insights provide analytics and metrics, such as repository traffic and contributor activity, to gain valuable insights into project performance.

#### Key Practices
- **Performance Metrics**: Define and monitor performance metrics to track project progress and identify areas for improvement.

## Settings

### GitHub Repository Settings

- Access repository settings to manage permissions, integrations, and other configuration options for effective project management.

#### Key Practices
- **Access Control**: Define access levels for repositories based on sensitivity and project requirements, ensuring appropriate access control.
- **Integration Management**: Manage integrations and configurations to streamline project workflows and enhance collaboration.

By following these practices and utilizing GitHub's comprehensive set of tools, Red Witch ensures a streamlined and efficient project management process, fostering collaboration, transparency, and innovation.
