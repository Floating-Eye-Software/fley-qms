
### Ontario Service Design Framework

Ontario’s service design journey follows design and release phases. Each phase is driven by user needs and prioritizes several points from the standard. Learn more about how to work in design and release phases in the [Service Design Playbook](https://www.ontario.ca/page/service-design-playbook).

### Discovery phase

Discovery helps define a service’s potential users and how their needs can be met.

In discovery:

* conduct user research
* decide who the primary user groups will be
* learn about the people who will use the service
* ask users what they want in a service
* check if there are existing or non-governmental services that meet user needs
* identify policies and other barriers that will make meeting user needs difficult
* document the findings

All services are different, but most projects need 4-8 weeks to for discovery.

#### **Deliverables**

* results of user research: user groups, personas, needs, expectations, etc
* results of market/regulatory/feasability research
* designate product manager
* establish [agile](https://www.ontario.ca/page/being-agile-ontario-public-service) workflow

### Alpha phase

While discovery is about research, alpha is about testing hypotheses and experimentation. The purpose of alpha is to determine how to meet the user needs that were identified in discovery. It’s an opportunity to quickly test many different approaches with users before building a service.

Alpha is fast-paced and may go in many unexpected directions before defining what the final solution could look like. Try new approaches to solving problems and test them quickly, so that potential issues can be found and fixed before investing too much time and money into one design.

In alpha:

* work directly with end users and stakeholders to co-create solutions
* build multiple prototypes of the service
* continuously test prototypes with users
* demonstrate that the service is technically and financially feasible
* estimate how much the service will cost
* identify existing processes or policies that will need to change to support the service

Alpha is a cyclical process of designing and testing potential solution options. Prototypes are built quickly, often together with users and stakeholders, and tested with real users. Feedback and testing results are used to improve the service. This process repeats itself until the prototype meets user needs and the first working version of the service is ready to be built. The first working version is called the minimum viable product. It will be built in the next phase, beta.

All services are different, but most teams will need 8-12 weeks to complete alpha.

#### **Deliverables**

* plan and conduct user testing
* prototypes and mockup designs from user testing
* journey map of user experience
* initial version of project plan containing:
    * technical approach / theory of operation
    * financial estimate for entire project
    * outline of plans for market surveillance, service, support, and updates

### Beta phase

Beta is when the service finally comes to life. The goal of beta is to build a real service that works well for a larger group of people. The prototypes that were developed and tested during alpha are used to build a minimum viable product in a live, user-facing environment.

Build quickly and in small segments, taking the time to confirm that each segment of the service is on the right track. Launching a public service is the ultimate usability test, as it collects real data and user feedback. Feedback is used to refine the service, adding and adjusting features until the service is complete.

In beta:

* make a prioritized list of the user stories that have already been researched
* build a minimum viable product that can be used by the public in a live environment
* continuously test the service with users to collect feedback and discover helpful insights
* test the design for accessibility and use assistive devices like screen readers
* measure the service against key performance indicators
* release updates to patch and improve the service
* resolve any remaining technical or process-related challenges

All services are different. Most teams need at least 3-4 months to complete beta.

#### **Deliverables**

* working version of service
* automated testing
* perform device validation on all platforms
* create privacy and security report
* create usability report
* include accessibility challenged user testers, leverage the [inclusive design cards](https://www.ontario.ca/page/inclusive-design-cards)
* include contact info / online help
* include [WCAG success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) in UI testing
* use consistent branding, leverage the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/)
* create plan for maintenance releases, outages, service monitoring
* create recovery plan for disasterous data loss
* create processes for updating server software as well as client devices
* create quality plan for frequent iterations including rollbacks and security fixes

### Live phase

Live begins when the service has reached a point of maturity and all of the main features in the backlog have been built. While most people understand the purpose of live, it’s not always given the attention and resources it deserves.

Without proper resources devoted to live, services become quickly outdated and fail to meet both the Digital Service Standard and user needs.

Continuous improvement is one of the core principles of service design and that’s what live is all about. The goal is to continuously monitor, research, test and iterate for as long as the service is active.

In live:

* monitor and track the status of the service and key performance indicators
* conduct ongoing user research and usability testing every three to four months
* continue building features from the backlog and releasing improvements to the service
* communicate and celebrate the successes of the service
* ensure the service continues to meet the Digital Service Standard

#### **Deliverables**

* continue service/maintenance after launch
* conduct usability testing periodically (after launch)
* support must be sustainable and free to access
* employ web analytics for product surveillance
* evaluate user complaints from all sources
* calculate performance metrics
* create and publish useful and open data
