### Notes on Usage

1. Each DSS phase is **mapped to concrete Red Witch deliverables**, ensuring traceability from regulatory expectations ‚Üí project outputs.  
2. Links to **GitHub Wiki pages and SDP sections** allow auditors to verify compliance easily.  
3. This appendix is a **living document** and should be updated iteratively as Red Witch evolves.

Perfect ‚úÖ ‚Äî let‚Äôs create a **Global Compliance Matrix** that takes every **Floating Eye SOP deliverable** and shows how it maps across **FDA (21 CFR 820 / 11), EU MDR (Annex II & III), ISO 13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, and IEC 62366**.

This becomes your ‚Äúsingle table of truth‚Äù you can show auditors from **any region** (FDA, EU, Canada, Japan, etc.).

## üîë How to Use This Matrix

* **Auditors**: You can show this table to FDA, EU Notified Body, or MDSAP auditor ‚Äî it demonstrates that every SOP deliverable maps to a regulatory requirement.
* **Projects**: Each project (Red Witch, or others) fills in *where* each deliverable is implemented (GitHub, Jira, Confluence, etc.).
* **Evidence storage**: Confluence = DHF/Tech File, Jira = traceability/testing, GitHub = code/config mgmt.

---

‚úÖ With this single matrix:

* You prove compliance to **FDA QSR (820) + Part 11**
* You prove compliance to **EU MDR Annex II/III**
* You meet **ISO 13485/14971/62304/62366** (which are the globally harmonized standards used in Canada, Australia, Brazil, Japan, etc.).
