# **Floating Eye Software (QMS v4) – Quality Manual**

## 0. Introduction

This Quality Manual defines the structure, scope, and operation of the Quality Management System (QMS) for **Floating Eye Software (FLEY)**.

The QMS is aligned with **ISO 9001:2015**, including **Amendment 1:2024 (Climate Action)**, and incorporates:

* **Process approach**
* **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle**
* **Risk-based thinking**

The QMS ensures that activities under its scope are **planned, implemented, monitored, and continually improved** to meet customer, regulatory, and ethical requirements.

## 1. Organization Overview

FLEY is a **sole proprietorship**, founded in 2021 in Toronto, Canada.
It develops ethical, privacy-first digital tools. Non-QMS activities (NetHack servers, blogs, unreleased product websites) are **outside the QMS**.

The **Red Witch** project is the first initiative formally managed under the QMS.

For full organizational context, internal/external issues, interested parties, and monitoring procedures, see [[Context of the Organization]].
