## **1. Purpose**

Identify internal and external issues influencing FLEY’s ability to achieve QMS outcomes (ISO 9001 Clause 4.1).

---

## **2. Internal Issues**

### **2.1 Startup / Lean / Volunteer Model**

* Strengths: Lean approach, ethical mission, flexibility
* Weaknesses: Limited capacity and redundancy (sole proprietor)
* Opportunities: Automation, community contributions
* Threats: Burnout, delays, inability to scale

### **2.2 Privacy & Trust**

* Strengths: Privacy-first philosophy, transparent operations
* Weaknesses: No formal certifications initially
* Opportunities: Strong positioning as an ad-free, trust-based app
* Threats: Any data breach or privacy lapse will significantly damage reputation

### **2.3 Clinical & Regulatory**

* Strengths: QMS foundation aligned to ISO / medical software standards
* Weaknesses: Lack of clinical advisory resources
* Opportunities: Compliance as differentiator
* Threats: Regulatory classification may impose burdens

### **2.4 Knowledge, Culture & Values**

* Volunteer-driven, centered around mission and ethics
* Knowledge concentrated in one person — risk of loss
* Culture of openness, transparency, minimalism

### **2.5 Climate Change Consideration**

* Determine whether **climate change is relevant** to organizational context
* Potential issues: infrastructure energy consumption, service hosting carbon footprint, extreme weather disruptions, regulatory or stakeholder expectations regarding sustainability
* If relevant, integrate into risk management and monitoring processes

## **5. Monitoring & Review**

* Review internal and external context at least **annually**, or with major product releases
* Monitor **climate-change signals**, regulatory updates, environmental expectations, and stakeholder demands
* Update identified issues, risks, and controls as appropriate
* Document context changes in management review records and reference them in [[Quality Manual]] and [[GitHub QMS Operations]]
