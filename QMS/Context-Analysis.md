## **3. Internal Context**

### **3.1 Professional Competence and Leadership**

* The QMS Owner holds an **ASQ Certified Software Quality Engineer (CSQE)** credential, a **degree in Computer Science**, and **over 15 years of quality-engineering experience** in the **medical-device industry**.
* This background provides deep expertise in ISO 9001, ISO 13485, and related standards; software verification & validation; design control; risk management; and regulatory compliance for safety-critical systems.
* These competencies ensure that FLEY’s QMS is founded on **recognized best practices** and **regulatory-grade quality principles** adapted to a lean, privacy-first software context.

### **3.2 Startup / Lean Model**

* Sole-proprietor structure allows rapid change and ethical consistency.
* Limited capacity introduces continuity and workload risks.
* Automation and open collaboration present growth opportunities.

### **3.3 Privacy & Trust**

* Privacy-first philosophy is a core differentiator.
* Lack of formal external certifications initially limits third-party assurance.
* Any privacy failure would significantly harm credibility.

### **3.4 Clinical, Ethical & Regulatory**

* QMS aligned with ISO 9001 and informed by ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 principles for health-software quality.
* Limited access to clinical and ethical advisory resources at current scale.
* Ongoing monitoring required for evolving reproductive-health and data-protection regulations.

### **3.5 Knowledge, Culture & Values**

* Centered on ethics, transparency, inclusivity, and respect for bodily autonomy.
* Knowledge concentrated in a single developer; documentation and continuity planning are essential.
* Strong culture of professional quality discipline carried over from regulated-industry experience.

## **4. External Context**

FLEY operates in an environment shaped by social expectations, legal frameworks, and technological change.

| **Factor**                  | **Relevant Issues**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Political / Legal**       | Divergent laws governing reproductive-health technologies and personal data; increasing expectations for ethical AI and privacy; potential future sustainability or environmental-reporting requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Economic**                | Volunteer-based startup; limited resources; potential for funding or partnerships tied to ethical and social-impact commitments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Social / Cultural**       | Growing awareness of reproductive autonomy and digital-privacy rights; expectation for inclusive, stigma-free technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Technological**           | Dependence on third-party platforms (GitHub, OpenAI, hosting providers); need for transparent, efficient, and privacy-preserving design.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Environmental / Climate** | Minimal direct environmental impact at current scale. Primary activity is remote software development with standard computing resources. FLEY monitors supplier compliance with **ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems)** where feasible and will reassess environmental relevance as operations expand. Objective, evidence-based evaluation of AI-related energy and water use will inform any future sustainability measures. |
| **Ethical / Human Rights**  | Reproductive freedom, bodily autonomy, and digital ethics are central to stakeholder trust and alignment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
