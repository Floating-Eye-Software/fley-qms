# **Context of the Organization (COTO) – Floating Eye Software (FLEY)**

## 0. Organization Overview

Floating Eye Software (FLEY) is a sole proprietorship founded in 2021 in Toronto, Canada.
FLEY develops ethical, privacy-first digital tools. Non-QMS activities (NetHack servers, blogs, unreleased product websites) are **outside the QMS**.

The **Red Witch** project is the first initiative formally managed under a QMS.

## 2. Internal Issues

### 2.1 Startup / Lean / Volunteer Model

* Strengths: Lean approach, ethical mission, flexibility
* Weaknesses: Limited capacity and redundancy (sole proprietor)
* Opportunities: Automation, community contributions
* Threats: Burnout, delays, inability to scale

### 2.2 Privacy & Trust

* Strengths: Privacy-first philosophy, transparent operations
* Weaknesses: No formal certifications initially
* Opportunities: Strong positioning as an ad-free, trust-based app
* Threats: Any data breach or privacy lapse will significantly damage reputation

### 2.3 Clinical & Regulatory

* Strengths: QMS foundation aligned to ISO / medical software standards
* Weaknesses: Lack of clinical advisory resources
* Opportunities: Compliance as differentiator
* Threats: Regulatory classification may impose burdens

### 2.4 Knowledge, Culture & Values

* Volunteer-driven, centered around mission and ethics
* Knowledge concentrated in one person — risk of loss
* Culture of openness, transparency, minimalism

### 2.5 Climate Change Consideration

* Determine whether **climate change is relevant** to organizational context
* Potential issues: infrastructure energy consumption, service hosting carbon footprint, extreme weather disruptions, regulatory or stakeholder expectations regarding sustainability
* If relevant, integrate into risk management and monitoring processes
