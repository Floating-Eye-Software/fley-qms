# üìù Risk Register ‚Äì Red Witch Project (FLEY)

## **1. Introduction**

This Risk Register identifies potential risks and opportunities arising from the **context of the organization (COTO)**.
It is maintained as part of the QMS to support **planning, risk-based thinking, and continual improvement** in accordance with **ISO 9001:2015 Clauses 4 & 6**.

**Scope:** Risks apply only to Red Witch. Other FLEY activities (NetHack server, blogs) are out of scope.
