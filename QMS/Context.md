# üåê Context of the Organization (COTO) ‚Äì Floating Eye Software (FLEY)

## **0. Organization Overview**

Floating Eye Software (FLEY) was founded in **2021 in Toronto** as a **sole proprietorship** with no employees.

FLEY engages in multiple activities, including:

* Running a **NetHack server** and developing a **NetHack variant**.
* Hosting blogs and web resources.
* Developing unreleased products and websites.

These activities are **outside the scope** of the QMS. **Red Witch** is the first project to define and operate under a formal QMS. This project serves as a **pilot** to establish processes, procedures, and documentation that may be applied to other projects in the future.

## **2. Internal Issues**

### **2.1 Startup / Lean Development (Volunteer-Driven)**

* Strengths: Independent, lean workflows, strong ethical mission
* Weaknesses: Sole developer, no paid employees, limited capacity
* Opportunities: Automation, incremental releases, attract volunteer contributors
* Threats: Burnout, delays, limited resources for regulatory or clinical compliance

### **2.2 Privacy & Trust**

* Strengths: Privacy-first design, open-source transparency
* Weaknesses: Lack of formal certifications, dependency on a single steward for GDPR compliance
* Opportunities: Differentiation through ethical, ad-free app
* Threats: Single privacy/data breach could destroy user trust

### **2.3 Clinical & Regulatory**

* Strengths: QMS foundation for ISO compliance, traceable records
* Weaknesses: Limited clinical expertise, unfunded, no external consultants
* Opportunities: Early compliance differentiates the project; potential nonprofit or academic collaboration
* Threats: Regulatory classification as a medical device could restrict distribution

### **2.4 Organizational Culture / Values / Knowledge**

* Volunteer-driven, mission-oriented culture
* Emphasis on transparency, ethical software development, and user privacy
* Knowledge concentrated in the sole proprietor; risk of knowledge loss
