**Slug:** MR-SOP-WI-Workflow-Plan
**Revision:** r1
**Effective Date:** 2025-11-17
**Related SOP:** Quality-Planning-SOP, Management-Review-SOP, FLEY-Action-Management WI
**Controlled Source:** `/Plans/MR-SOP-WI-Workflow-Plan.md`

## **1. Introduction**

* **Purpose:**
  Define and implement a milestone-driven QMS governance model using GitHub Plan Issues. Transition MR cycles and associated SOP/WI updates to a controlled Plan-based workflow with proper traceability, verification of effectiveness (VoE), and ISO 9001 alignment.

* **Scope:**
  This Plan covers all actions required to update SOPs, WIs, GitHub templates, and MR cycles for Floating Eye Software QMS. It applies to all process owners, contributors, and top management involved in MR and QMS operational activities.

* **Applicable Standards & Regulations:**

  * ISO 9001:2015 – Clauses 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
  * Relevant internal SOPs and WIs: Quality-Planning-SOP, Management-Review-SOP, FLEY-Action-Management WI
  * Document control and record retention policies

## **2. Quality Objectives**

1. Implement a consistent milestone-driven workflow for MR cycles and related QMS actions.
2. Update SOPs and WIs to reflect the new Plan-based execution model.
3. Introduce `type:Plan` GitHub Issue type with milestone structure, start/end dates, and VoE criteria.
4. Ensure traceability between Plan, milestones, Issues, CAPAs, Pull Requests, and MR inputs.
5. Verify effectiveness of Plan execution and document residual risks, lessons learned, and follow-up actions.
6. Complete the first MR cycle under the new Plan workflow and demonstrate successful VoE.

## **3. Quality Processes**

* Transition MR cycles from child-linked Issues to `type:Plan` Issues with dedicated milestones.
* Revise SOPs and WIs to reference Plan-based execution (MR SOP, Quality-Planning SOP, FLEY-Action-Management WI, GitHub-QMS-Setup WI).
* Update GitHub templates:

  * Quality-Plan-Template
  * TPL-GH-Plan Issue Template
* Implement milestone-based tracking for all associated Issues (Objectives, Risks, CAPAs, Improvements).
* Link all work items (Issues, PRs, audits) to Plan milestones for traceable execution.
* Perform Verification of Effectiveness (VoE) per Plan to confirm actions were completed and objectives met.

## **4. Metrics & Measurement**

* % of SOPs/WIs updated to reference Plan workflow
* % of GitHub Plan Issues created for MR cycles and major initiatives
* % of milestones completed within Plan timeline
* % of Issues linked to Plan milestones
* VoE completion and effectiveness assessment for each Plan

---

## **5. Quality Assurance Activities**

* Review all SOP/WI drafts by Quality Manager and Process Owners
* Internal audit of GitHub Plan Issue implementation and milestone linkage
* Verification of pull requests linked to controlled Plans and milestones
* Peer review of Plan execution and VoE documentation
* Monitor first MR cycle execution under new workflow for adherence to objectives

| Role                      | Responsibility                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quality Manager           | Approve Plan, ensure traceability, monitor progress, verify VoE        |
| Process Owners            | Update assigned SOPs/WIs, implement Plan actions, provide evidence     |
| Top Management            | Approve Plan objectives and MR cycle changes, oversee MR execution     |

## **7. Records & Documentation**

* Controlled Plan document (`/Plans/MR-SOP-WI-Workflow-Plan.md`)
* GitHub Plan Issues (`type:Plan`) and milestone-linked Issues
* Pull Requests linked to Plan actions
* Audit records of Plan implementation
* Verification of Effectiveness records, including lessons learned and residual risks

---

## **8. Linkage to Execution**

* **Milestones:**

  1. Update GitHub templates and labels
  2. Revise SOPs/WIs for Plan-based execution
  3. Execute first MR cycle using Plan Issue type
  4. Verification of Effectiveness (VoE) documentation

* **Project Board / Tracking Tool:** GitHub FLEY QMS Board – all milestones and Issues tracked

* **Pull Requests:** Link all SOP/WI changes and template updates to Plan milestones

* **Issues / CAPA:** Link MR actions, risks, objectives, and improvements to Plan milestones

---

## **9. Verification of Effectiveness**

* **Verification Date:** TBD upon first MR cycle completion
* **Summary:** Confirm that all Plan milestones are completed, SOP/WI updates are applied, GitHub templates function correctly, and MR cycles run under the new workflow.
* **Evidence:** GitHub Issue and milestone completion, PR approvals, attached audit records, VoE documentation in Plan Issue comments
* **Follow-up:** Capture residual risks, improvement actions, and lessons learned for next MR cycle
* **Assessment:** Effective / Partially Effective / Ineffective
