
# **Quality Plan – Pilot SOP Implementation (FLEY)**

## **1. Introduction**

* **Purpose:** Pilot Red Witch project workflows to draft, test, validate, and refine FLEY SOPs, ensuring alignment with ISO 9001, ISO 13485, IEC 62304, and GDPR.
* **Scope:** Organization-wide; applies to SOP development, WI drafting, and template standardization.
* **Applicable Standards & Regulations:** ISO 13485:2016 Clauses 5.4, 7.1; ISO 9001:2015; IEC 62304; 21 CFR 820.20(d), 820.30(b); GDPR; ISO 9004.

## **2. Quality Objectives**

* Draft ≥5 SOPs based on Red Witch project experience (Design Control, CAPA, Code Review, Testing, Privacy).
* Validate SOPs with real project evidence and DCP alignment.
* Conduct post-pilot lessons learned reviews after each release.

---

## **3. Quality Processes**

* Identify Red Witch workflows suitable for SOP standardization.
* Draft SOPs in Wiki and submit via GitHub PR workflow for review.
* Pilot SOPs within Red Witch project; collect usage evidence (issues, PRs, CI/CD logs).
* Revise SOPs quarterly based on pilot feedback and CAPA findings.
* Ensure SOPs map to DCP deliverables and WI-QMS-09-04 checkpoints.

## **4. Metrics & Measurement**

* # of SOPs drafted vs. target.
* # of SOPs validated through project evidence.
* % of SOPs updated based on pilot feedback.
* Traceability of SOPs → DCP/WI deliverables.

---

## **5. Quality Assurance Activities**

* QA review of draft SOPs before approval.
* Internal audits against pilot SOPs.
* Cross-functional review and feedback sessions with development and QA teams.

---

## **6. Roles & Responsibilities**

* **Quality Manager:** Oversees drafting, approval, and QA compliance of SOPs.
* **Project Manager (Red Witch):** Ensures SOPs are trialed in active project workflows.
* **Developers & Team Members:** Follow SOPs, provide structured feedback and evidence.

---

## **7. Records & Documentation**

* SOP drafts, approvals, and revisions stored in GitHub Wiki.
* Pilot evidence captured in GitHub issues, PRs, and CI/CD logs.
* Lessons learned documented in Wiki and linked to SOP updates.
