## **QMS Foundations (Updated)**

**Description:**
This milestone establishes the initial Quality Management System (QMS) framework using the Red Witch project as a pilot and culminates in the creation of a controlled QMS repository (`fley-qms`) as the authoritative source for all QMS documentation.

It validates foundational workflows including documentation, change control, traceability, evidence capture, and continuous improvement, preparing the organization for subsequent stages — including audit-ready QMS documentation and full configuration control.

**Scope (Issues & PRs):**

* #1: Core QMS Documentation (5 Docs)
* #2: Configure Project Board
* #3: Set Up Wiki Structure
* #4: Branch Protection / Nonconformance fixes
* #5: Draft First SOP (SDLC) *(moved to next milestone for Audit-Ready QMS)*
* #6: Define Effectiveness Check Plan
* #7: SOP – Pull Request Procedure / Change Control
* #22: New GitHub Issue Type for Plans / Opportunities
* #23: Record Export Process & Retention
* **Continuous Improvement workflow / plan issues**
* #28: Create Controlled QMS Repository

**Goals:**

* Pilot the QMS setup through the Red Witch project as a controlled design activity.
* Develop a minimal but functional QMS backbone (core docs, SOPs, wiki, project boards).
* Demonstrate evidence collection and traceability using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
* Track plan-type and continuous improvement issues.
* Ensure branch protection, CODEOWNERS, and repository configuration enforce QMS controls.
* Migrate approved pilot documentation to the controlled repository and create the initial QMS baseline tag (`QMS_Baseline_r1`).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Red Witch wiki contains the 5 initial core docs.
* Project board configured and in use.
* Wiki structure supports SOPs, work instructions, and project docs.
* Compliance evidence storage method defined and working.
* Draft SDLC SOP created *(moved to Audit-Ready milestone)*
* Effectiveness check plan documented.
* Pull Request / Change Control SOP drafted and applied in Red Witch.
* Record export & retention processes defined and documented.
* Branch protection nonconformances resolved.
* New GitHub Issue Type (“Plan”) available and functional.
* Continuous Improvement workflow implemented and tracked.
* Controlled QMS repository (`fley-qms`) created and configured with branch protection and CODEOWNERS.
* Initial migration Pull Request merged and tagged `QMS_Baseline_r1` with Top Management approval recorded.

**Outcome:**

Completion of this milestone results in a **validated, functioning QMS foundation** with a functioning pilot environment, continuous improvement workflow, and a formally controlled QMS repository (`fley-qms`). This prepares the organization for subsequent milestones such as Audit-Ready QMS and Compliance Backbone.
