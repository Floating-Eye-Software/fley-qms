Welcome to the **FLEY QMS**, the central documentation and compliance management system for **Floating Eye Software (FLEY)** and its projects, including the original **Red Witch pilot project**.

This repository serves as the single source of truth for all controlled documentation — including policies, procedures, work instructions, plans, and compliance records.

## **1. Quality Management System (QMS)**

The FLEY QMS is aligned with **ISO 9001:2015** and **ISO 9001:2024 (Climate Action Amendment)** principles, emphasizing risk-based thinking, process control, and continual improvement.

## **3. Compliance Standards**

The FLEY QMS maintains a central register of applicable standards and regulatory frameworks.

* [Compliance Index](Compliance/README.md)
* [ISO 9001](Compliance/ISO-9001.md)

Additional standards (ISO 13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, etc.) will be added as mappings are developed.

---

## **4. Governance and Usage**

* The FLEY QMS is the **authoritative system of record** for all controlled documentation.
* Each controlled document is versioned, approved, and traceable through GitHub commits, Issues, and PRs.
* QMS artifacts, compliance evidence, and CAPA records are maintained in this repository.
* To onboard or prepare for an audit, begin with the [Quality Manual](QMS/Quality-Manual.md).
