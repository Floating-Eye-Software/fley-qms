# üåç Supporting Diverse Users  

Our app is designed to serve a wide spectrum of users, each with unique needs, identities, cultural contexts, and reproductive goals. We recognize that menstruation and body-tracking experiences are deeply personal, and we are committed to creating a product that respects privacy, inclusivity, and choice.  

To support this diversity, we prioritize the following principles:  

1. **Privacy and Safety First**  

   - Especially for minors, people in stigmatized contexts, or those at risk from abusive partners.  
   - Features: discreet notifications, app-level locks, decoy modes, encryption.  

2. **Cultural and Religious Sensitivity**  

   - Users from Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Wiccan, and other traditions have different needs.  
   - We provide customizable language, neutral educational content, and optional culturally-specific features.  

3. **Identity Inclusion**  

   - Support for trans men, queer teens, AMAB users, and anyone outside binary gender expectations.  
   - Gender-neutral language and customizable pronouns.  

4. **Reproductive Goals and Choices**  

   - Users may be TTC, childfree, avoiding pregnancy, postpartum, perimenopausal, or focused on health.  
   - The app adapts with tailored features like fertility awareness tools, childfree mode, or cycle-independent tracking.  

5. **Age-Appropriate Design**  

   - Minors have special protections. For under 18, the app provides age-appropriate education, optional parental consent, and safeguards for sensitive health info.  

6. **Empowerment through Knowledge**  

   - Beyond tracking, the app educates users, surfaces insights, and promotes confidence through customizable tracking and visualization.
