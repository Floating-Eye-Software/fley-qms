## 4. Implications for Red Witch Design

* **Differentiation Opportunity:**

  * Combine **privacy-first design** (local storage, pseudonyms, no ads) with **scientific transparency** (clear disclaimers, evidence references).
* **Risk Management:**

  * Explicitly prevent **off-label use as contraception** unless regulatory clearance is sought.
  * Prioritize **data minimization** and **offline functionality**, aligning with PMS-004 and prior external design inputs.
* **Feature Roadmap Considerations:**

  * Evaluate **partner-sharing** and **wearables integration** carefully for user demand vs. privacy risks.
  * Explore **global accessibility features** (multilingual, cultural sensitivity, offline support).
