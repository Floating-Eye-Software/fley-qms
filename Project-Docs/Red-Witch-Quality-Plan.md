# **Red Witch – Project Quality Plan (PQP)**

**Project Manager / Owner:** [Name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Version:** [X.X]

> This PQP defines how the **Red Witch** project implements the **Floating Eye Software (FLEY) QMS**, including configuration of SOPs, Work Instructions (WIs), and tools used to achieve compliance.

---

## **1. QMS Activity Configuration**

Each project defines its own QMS implementation “stack.”
All SOPs remain in effect; this table specifies the **selected methods, tools, and WIs** used to meet each SOP for *Red Witch*.

**Configuration Rules**

* All QMS activities must be executed using the selected methods/tools.
* Configuration must be reviewed and approved by **PM** and **Quality Manager** before project start.
* Updates require a **Change Request** per SOP-02.
* Applicable standards determined by **intended use** and **regulatory classification**.
