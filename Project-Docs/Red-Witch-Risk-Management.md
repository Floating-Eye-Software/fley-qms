# üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Misuse Risk Management

## 1. **Unauthorized Tracking of Another Person**

* **Scenario**: Someone tries to track a partner, coworker, or friend without consent.
* **Risk**: Privacy violation, potential legal exposure, user safety compromised.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Require **explicit opt-in / consent** for any shared tracking.
  * Enforce **account boundaries**: logs cannot be added for someone else without their confirmation.
  * Provide clear warnings about ethical/legal implications of non-consensual tracking.

## 2. **Abusive Partner / Family Member Access**

* **Scenario**: Someone with physical access to the device (partner, sibling, parent) tries to view cycle logs or app notes.
* **Risk**: Physical or emotional harm, coercion, domestic abuse escalation.
* **Mitigation**:

  * **Strong PIN/biometric lock** inside the app (separate from phone lock).
  * Optional **decoy mode** with fake data or blank interface.
  * Quick **app exit / hide screen gesture**.
  * Discreet app icon and name.
  * Educate users on device-level security.

## 3. **Law Enforcement / Government Access**

* **Scenario**: Police or government gains access via device seizure or legal requests.
* **Risk**: Sensitive personal data exposure, legal jeopardy in restrictive environments.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Minimize data stored on servers.
  * End-to-end encryption of all sensitive data.
  * Collect only essential information; avoid identifiable metadata where possible.
  * Jurisdiction-aware storage strategies (e.g., Canada vs US).
  * Transparent privacy policy explaining what can/cannot be legally accessed.

## 4. **Casual Unauthorized Access**

* **Scenario**: Someone casually grabs the user‚Äôs device to snoop (friend, coworker, sibling).
* **Risk**: Embarrassment, minor social harm.
* **Mitigation**:

  * PIN/biometric lock.
  * Neutral notifications.
  * Optional quick-lock / hide feature.

---

## 5. **Device Theft or Loss**

* **Scenario**: Phone containing the app is lost or stolen.
* **Risk**: All data exposed to any unauthorized person.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Device encryption.
  * Remote wipe or account-based deactivation.
  * Strong authentication for app access.

## 6. **Data Breach / Unauthorized Remote Access**

* **Scenario**: Hacker or unauthorized app user gains server access.
* **Risk**: Exposure of sensitive health information.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Encrypt all data at rest and in transit.
  * Limit backend access; audit logs regularly.
  * Use strong authentication and security monitoring.

---

## 7. **Notifications or Reminders Revealing Sensitive Info**

* **Scenario**: Push notifications reveal period or symptom info on a shared device.
* **Risk**: Unintended disclosure to family, roommates, or coworkers.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Neutral/ambiguous wording (‚ÄúWellness check-in‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúYour period starts today‚Äù).
  * Allow **customizable notification text** or hide notifications entirely.

---

## 8. **Shared Data Export / Third-Party Sharing**

* **Scenario**: User exports data or syncs with third-party apps without full understanding.
* **Risk**: Sensitive data leaves the platform; potential misuse.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Confirm **explicit consent** before exporting or syncing.
  * Provide educational prompts about privacy implications.
  * Allow users to **revoke access at any time**.

---

## 9. **Social Engineering / Phishing**

* **Scenario**: User is tricked into giving login credentials or personal health info.
* **Risk**: Account compromise, personal data leaks.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Educate users: ‚ÄúNever share passwords or verification codes.‚Äù
  * Use secure login flows; avoid sending sensitive data via email.

---

## 10. **Edge Cases for Sensitive Populations**

* Users in stigmatized contexts, conservative religious communities, LGBTQ+ minors, sex workers, or high-risk locales.
* **Risk**: Disclosure could result in social, legal, or physical harm.
* **Mitigation**:

  * Privacy-first defaults.
  * Discreet app icon & neutral UI.
  * Anonymous accounts or hidden usage options.
  * Respect user-defined gender, language, and cultural preferences.

### ‚úÖ Key Principles

1. **Layered protection**: App-level locks, encryption, neutral design.
2. **User consent & autonomy**: Explicit opt-in for shared or exported data.
3. **Minimal data storage**: Collect only what‚Äôs necessary, protect high-stakes users.
4. **Education & transparency**: Users must understand risks and available safeguards.
