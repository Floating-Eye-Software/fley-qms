# 🛣️ Product Roadmap Options

---

## **Option 1: Stay Focused on Menstruation (Specialized)**

### 🎯 Vision

Be the **most inclusive, private, culturally sensitive period tracker** — specialized but deeply trusted.

**Brand Positioning Statement**

> *We are the most inclusive and respectful period tracker — built for people who menstruate, no matter their culture, identity, or life stage. We put your privacy first, give you reliable predictions, and empower you with knowledge, without judgment or stigma.*

**Tagline Ideas**

* “Your cycle, your way.”
* “Private. Respectful. Empowering.”
* “Finally, a period app that gets it.”

**Identity**: A safe, trusted space specifically for menstruation — not diluted, but deeply empathetic.

### 📍 MVP (0–6 months)

* Private, discreet design (neutral icon, PIN lock).
* Accurate cycle predictions + basic symptom logging.
* Fertility awareness tools.
* Customizable language (gender-neutral or affirming).
* Educational content (cycle literacy, respectful framing).

### 🚀 Next Phase (6–18 months)

* Adaptive algorithms for irregular cycles (teen, postpartum, perimenopause).
* Postpartum tracking features.
* Perimenopause education + symptom logs.
* Anonymous use mode (no account required).
* Optional mental health check-ins.

### 🌍 Long-Term (18+ months)

* Expanded cultural localizations (e.g. cycle + holiday/ceremony planning).
* Partnerships with healthcare providers, NGOs, feminist orgs.
* Premium tier: advanced analytics for menstruators (e.g., mood correlations, lifestyle impact).

**Pros:**

* Strong niche positioning.
* Easier brand identity → “the respectful period app.”
* Easier to gain trust in sensitive markets.

**Cons:**

* Limited total addressable market (excludes non-menstruators).
* May feel less innovative compared to broader health trackers.

## **Option 2: Evolve Into a General Health / Body Tracking Platform (Inclusive of AMAB)**

### 🎯 Vision

Be the **inclusive body tracking app** that starts with periods but grows into a **holistic self-tracking tool for everyone**.


**Brand Positioning Statement**

> *We are the first truly inclusive body tracking app — starting with your cycle, but designed for anyone who wants to understand their body better. Whether you menstruate or not, we help you find patterns, predict changes, and make informed choices about your health and wellbeing.*

**Tagline Ideas**

* “Know your body. All of it.”
* “More than a period app.”
* “Patterns for everyone.”

**Identity**: A holistic health insights platform — cycles are one entry point, but the value expands to anyone curious about their body data.

### 📍 MVP (0–6 months)

(Same as Option 1: menstruation-focused core.)

### 🚀 Next Phase (6–18 months)

* Custom tracking categories (energy, libido, sleep, exercise).
* Cycle-independent mode (for AMAB users, trans people on blockers, post-hysterectomy, etc.).
* Data visualization & correlations (e.g., “Your energy dips 3 days after poor sleep”).
* Community mode with diverse profiles (not just menstruation-focused).

### 🌍 Long-Term (18+ months)

* Positioning as a **“self-knowledge” app** vs. “period tracker.”
* Partnerships with wellness/fitness platforms.
* Potential expansion into wearable integrations (Fitbit, Oura, Apple Health).
* AI-driven insights: predictive analytics across all tracked factors (not just cycles).

**Pros:**

* Bigger market (everyone, not just menstruators).
* Differentiation: stands out from Flo/Clue as broader and more inclusive.
* Future-proof (doesn’t trap you in reproductive-health-only space).

**Cons:**

* Brand identity risk: could alienate menstruating users if it feels “diluted” or “male-centered.”
* More complex to execute → broader feature set, harder UX choices.
* Requires stronger privacy guarantees (since broader tracking = more sensitive data).

# 🔑 Strategic Trade-Offs

* **Option 1 (Specialized)**: safer, culturally respectful, easier to market → but narrower.
    Says: *“We’re here for menstruators — period.”*

* **Option 2 (Generalized)**: bigger, more inclusive, future-proof → but brand risk and complexity.
    Says: *“We’re here for everyone — period is just the start.”*
