* **SR-4:** The app shall support biometric and/or PIN access.
* **SR-5:** The app shall lock automatically after configurable inactivity.
* **SR-6:** The system shall not transmit any PHI to third parties.
* **SR-7:** The system shall maintain audit logs of failed login attempts.

### 3.3 Regulatory Requirements (RR)

* **RR-1:** The app shall provide explicit consent dialogs in compliance with GDPR and PIPEDA.
* **RR-2:** The app shall provide a mechanism for the user to delete all data (‚Äúright to erasure‚Äù).
* **RR-3:** The app shall implement privacy by design and by default (GDPR Art. 25).
* **RR-4:** If marketed for contraceptive/diagnostic use, the app shall meet EU MDR Class IIa requirements.
* **RR-5:** If marketed in Canada as a medical device, the app shall undergo Health Canada licensing review.

### 3.4 Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

* **NFR-1:** Response time shall be <1 second for logging events.
* **NFR-2:** The system shall support 10 years of cycle data without degradation.
* **NFR-3:** The UI shall meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
* **NFR-4:** The app shall support English and French at launch; multilingual expansion planned.
