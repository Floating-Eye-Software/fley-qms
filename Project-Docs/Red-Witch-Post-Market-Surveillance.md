## 2. PMS Workflow

1. **Identification**

   * Sources: Academic research, media reports, regulatory alerts, user feedback, app store reviews.
   * Assign a unique **PMS ID** to each item.

2. **Documentation**

   * Record source, type, summary, potential risk or design input, linked RMF/SRS references, and owner.

3. **Evaluation**

   * Determine if the item represents a **risk**, a **new design input**, or both.
   * Assign to appropriate team (QA/RA, Product, Development).

4. **Action / Mitigation**

   * Update RMF, SRS, or QMS procedures as necessary.
   * Monitor and track outcomes (e.g., app updates, user education materials).

5. **Review & Reporting**

   * Conduct PMS reviews quarterly or after major findings.
   * Record updates, new actions, and status in this log.

## 3. Notes

* All PMS items must be version-controlled in accordance with **RW-QMS-002 â€“ Document Control Procedure**.
* External reports should **not be copied in full**; provide a summary and a link to the source.
* PMS entries can be linked directly to **Design Input Wiki pages** for traceability.

---

## 4. Future Expansion

* Add **user complaints** as they are received.
* Include **regulatory alerts or safety notices** relevant to data privacy, medical device classification, or digital health regulations.
* Track **post-release app metrics**, such as adoption rates, crashes, or reported privacy issues.
