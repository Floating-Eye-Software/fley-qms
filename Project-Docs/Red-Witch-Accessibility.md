**Document Type:**
External Design Input / Market & Equity Evidence
**Purpose:**
Provide evidence of global accessibility challenges, language and technology barriers, and diverse user needs in the context of menstrual cycle tracking apps. Used to inform inclusive design requirements and risk management in the Red Witch project.

### 1. Summary of Key Findings

* **Global Usage Patterns:**
  A systematic review of 49 studies highlighted that while menstrual cycle tracking apps are widely used, their adoption varies significantly across regions, influenced by factors such as digital literacy, access to technology, and cultural perceptions of menstruation.

* **Language Barriers:**
  Many apps are predominantly available in English, limiting accessibility for non-English-speaking populations. This linguistic gap can lead to misunderstandings and reduced usability among diverse user groups.

* **Technology Access:**
  Access to smartphones and the internet is uneven across regions. In low-resource settings, women may face challenges such as limited device access, unreliable internet connectivity, and lack of digital literacy, hindering the effective use of menstrual tracking apps.

* **Cultural Sensitivity:**
  Cultural norms and taboos surrounding menstruation can affect the willingness of women to use digital health tools. Apps that do not consider cultural contexts may face resistance or misuse.
