# Red Witch Design Control

We will comply with the Ontario [Digital and Data Directive](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-and-data-directive-2021) by conforming to the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard) via adherence to the service design framework established in the [Service Design Playbook](https://www.ontario.ca/page/service-design-playbook).

## Ontario Digital and Data Directive, 2021

### Principles

The following principles support the requirements of this directive and are intended to guide ministries in interpreting and applying the directive.

* **Prioritization of user needs**: The needs of the user, determined through research and testing, are the first consideration in digital service delivery and the release of open data.
* **Transparency**: Government operates in a way that is easy for others to see what, why and how something is done.
* **Equitable access**: Access is equally available to all users.
* **Data informed**: The use of data is considered in decision-making.
* **Continuous improvement**: Government works in a way that demonstrates on-going, iterative improvement that is responsive to user need and supportive of the realization of benefit.

### Requirements

In order to support the government in achieving its objectives ministries and provincial agencies must address the following requirements.

### Digital Services

Ministry and provincial agency digital services, whether internally built or procured, must be designed, delivered and implemented according to [Ontario’s Digital Service Standard](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard#section-1) (DSS).

Ministry and provincial agency digital services must be:

* designed in a user-centred manner, address user needs and be supportive of the users’ journey from end to end as determined through active user research
* continuously evaluated and improved in an iterative manner
* made with technology that is scalable, interoperable, secure, accessible and open
* designed to take advantage of reusable technology and data where available
* designed in an iterative manner by a multi-disciplinary team that is empowered to prioritize incremental work and make decisions in the open whenever possible and designed to make the most effective use of data

In procuring a digital service, ministries must include Digital Service Standard requirements in their procurement documents. As best practice, provincial agencies should consider including Digital Service Standard requirements in their procurement documents.


### Digital Governance

All ministry digital services and all ministry IT projects in excess of $1M (whether built internally or procured) must:

* Be evaluated against the DSS through digital and IT governance processes (for example, Digital First Assessments, Architecture Review Board, or other governance processes as established)

Assessment against the DSS must occur at each phase in the digital service design cycle.

### Measurement

Ministry and provincial agency digital services must demonstrate their contributions to broader service or policy outcomes and establish evaluation and analytics approaches to support continuous improvement.  

At a minimum, all digital services must: 

* identify the service or policy outcomes to which the digital service is contributing and how the digital service will be evaluated throughout service design and post launch
* use service analytics to understand user behaviour across channels
* define performance metrics for the service up-front, early in the design process
* analyze performance and identify actionable data insights as early as possible
* monitor and report on the realization and sustainment of benefits as applicable
