## Ontario Digital and Data Directive, 2021 (excerpts)

### Application and Scope

This directive outlines requirements for ministries and provincial agencies for the design and delivery of digital services and for the proactive sharing of government data assets.

### Principles

The following principles support the requirements of this directive and are intended to guide ministries in interpreting and applying the directive.

* **Prioritization of user needs**: The needs of the user, determined through research and testing, are the first consideration in digital service delivery and the release of open data.
* **Transparency**: Government operates in a way that is easy for others to see what, why and how something is done.
* **Equitable access**: Access is equally available to all users.
* **Data informed**: The use of data is considered in decision-making.
* **Continuous improvement**: Government works in a way that demonstrates on-going, iterative improvement that is responsive to user need and supportive of the realization of benefit.

### Requirements

In order to support the government in achieving its objectives ministries and provincial agencies must address the following requirements.

### Digital Services

Ministry and provincial agency digital services, whether internally built or procured, must be designed, delivered and implemented according to [Ontario’s Digital Service Standard](https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-service-standard#section-1) (DSS).

Ministry and provincial agency digital services must be:

* designed in a user-centred manner, address user needs and be supportive of the users’ journey from end to end as determined through active user research
* continuously evaluated and improved in an iterative manner
* made with technology that is scalable, interoperable, secure, accessible and open
* designed to take advantage of reusable technology and data where available
* designed in an iterative manner by a multi-disciplinary team that is empowered to prioritize incremental work and make decisions in the open whenever possible and designed to make the most effective use of data

### Digital Governance

All ministry digital services and all ministry IT projects in excess of $1M (whether built internally or procured) must:

* Be evaluated against the DSS through digital and IT governance processes (for example, Digital First Assessments, Architecture Review Board, or other governance processes as established)

Assessment against the DSS must occur at each phase in the digital service design cycle.

### Measurement

Ministry and provincial agency digital services must demonstrate their contributions to broader service or policy outcomes and establish evaluation and analytics approaches to support continuous improvement.  

At a minimum, all digital services must: 

* identify the service or policy outcomes to which the digital service is contributing and how the digital service will be evaluated throughout service design and post launch
* use service analytics to understand user behaviour across channels
* define performance metrics for the service up-front, early in the design process
* analyze performance and identify actionable data insights as early as possible
* monitor and report on the realization and sustainment of benefits as applicable

### Data

Ministries and provincial agencies must be fully transparent about their data assets and the ways in which they are acquired and used.

Ministry and provincial agency data assets are open by default unless exempted from release in limited and specific circumstances as set out below:

* Data that is subject to statutory confidentiality requirements, (for example, exempt from publication under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 1990, the Personal Health Information Protection Act, 2004, the Anti-Racism Act, 2017 and/or other statutes).

* Data that should not be disclosed for legal, security, confidentiality, privacy or commercial sensitivity reasons as identified by expert assessors (for example, legal counsel, ITS security or privacy professional) as described in the [Open Data Guidebook](https://www.ontario.ca/document/open-data-guidebook-guide-open-data-directive-2015) (2015).

Directors closest to the data must ensure the appropriate expert assessment occurs prior to the publication of data and approve its release.

Ministries and provincial agencies ensure exempted data remains secure and is managed responsibly.

Open data must be accurate, timely, openly accessible, interpretable, coherent, de-identified, primary and released in accordance with the principles in the [International Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/principles/).

Ministries are required to consult and comply with the Open Data Guidebook. Provincial agencies should use the Open Data Guidebook as an example of best practices to adopt.

### Open Data Publication

All open data must be released in an open format.

Open data must be released at no charge to the user (for example, for-profit business, researcher or interested party etc.) and under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.ontario.ca/page/open-government-licence-ontario) – Ontario (See Appendix) and/or a similar open licence in consultation with users and on the advice of counsel.

No data assets released as open data are to be deleted or removed from public access except where it was published in error.

Ministry open data is to be published to the [Ontario Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/) in the language in which it was collected. The dataset title, description, and all accompanying supporting information must be available simultaneously in both English and French.


### Roles and Responsibilities

**Corporate Chief Information Officer**
* provide strategic leadership, advice and direction to ministries on technology to enable digital service delivery
* ensure that all data management platforms, applications and solutions acquired or built have open data features as a core function, in accordance with this directive
* embed digital and data policies, guidelines and standards across and into the IT organization

**Program Directors**
* ensure that a risk-based assessment process following the Open Data Guidebook is applied prior to the release of open data
* approve the release of open data as set out in this directive


### Definitions

**Governance**
Rules, systems and accountability structures that enable an organization to ensure that service development and delivery activities comply with all applicable regulations and legislation, optimize investments and risk, ensure the achievement of benefits and deliver on government mandate/priorities, while remaining mindful of user needs.

### Release in phases

Ontario’s service design journey follows design and release phases. Each phase is driven by user needs and prioritizes several points from the standard. Learn more about how to work in design and release phases in the [Service Design Playbook](https://www.ontario.ca/page/service-design-playbook).

* **Discovery**
Conducting user research to understand user needs

* **Alpha**
Testing our hypotheses with users using prototypes, models, examples or mock-ups

* **Beta**
Developing a minimum viable product or service that adds immediate value for users while the team develops and improves features.

* **Live**
Continuing to improve the service or product based on user feedback and data

### 1. Understand users and their needs

* list all your user groups and their needs and expectations
* address any gaps when testing during the alpha and beta stages
* give examples of user personas for the online service
* identify areas users find difficult and any problems that need to be overcome
* observe user behaviour in testing to improve your understanding of users and their needs

In the next stage:

* test and observe real users interacting with the service/product and be able to explain:
    * any new insights and lessons
    * how test participants were recruited
    * how analytics were used in research
    * number of test participants and their basic demographics
    * number of test participants who experienced accessibility challenges or needed assisted digital support
* explain any changes identified as a result of researching with users
* discuss user needs that are the most difficult to meet
* talk about the design challenges that user needs pose for the service/product

In the live stage:

* show research that identifies parts of the task users still find difficult
* demonstrate improvements to those areas and how they were tested and researched
* talk about how research results will be used to continuously improve user experience, for example, participants, frequency, location, timing

### 2. Establish the right team

* work collaboratively
* identify gaps in the team and fill them
* transfer knowledge and skills to others
* dedicate one user researcher to the service/product
* build a team with expertise in agile, lean and digital service delivery, technical, user experience and policy skills
* embed expertise from other business areas and ministries, for example, finance, legal, policy, correspondence, to achieve desired outcomes
* have a product manager with the ability to make day-to-day decisions to improve the service
* continue to improve the service or product after it’s gone live
* involve the maintenance team for the service or product in the early design phases
* make sure the team has senior and executive sponsorship to support their decisions, goals and vision for the service or product

### 3. Be consistent

* put web content on the government’s flagship website Ontario.ca rather than create any new websites or mobile applications
* use an Ontario.ca/keyword, for example [Ontario.ca/ontario-digital-service](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-digital-service), for websites and marketing, rather than register new public-facing domain names
* use Ontario.ca as the front door for all applications on other platforms, for example [how the Ontario Student Assistance Program uses Ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca/page/osap-ontario-student-assistance-program)
* apply [Ontario.ca content standards](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarioca-style-guide) to maintain the consistent tone, voice and style of government content that’s easy to find, understand and use
* use the [Ontario Design System](https://designsystem.ontario.ca/) to develop your digital service or product
* demonstrate that the service or product is responsive and has the same content and functionality on all devices, including mobile phones
* register domain names through [domain.registration@ontario.ca](mailto:domain.registration@ontario.ca) if needed
