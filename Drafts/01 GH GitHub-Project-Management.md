3. Where Project Management Comes In

Now, you asked: “Am I talking about a project management SOP?”

Project Management SOP (if you had one) would define how the project itself is planned, executed, monitored, and reported, including things like:

How backlog items are created from requirements

How sprint planning is done

How issues are tracked on GitHub

How progress is reported to stakeholders

Your situation: The “work” (implementing requirements) is performed via the Design Control SOP. The management of that work (tracking it as issues, planning sprints, moving through Kanban columns) would be covered by a project management SOP or work instruction, if your organization required one.

So:

Design Control SOP → governs how to perform design changes (the actual work).

Project Management SOP / WI → governs how to plan, track, and report that work (workflow management, sprint planning, GitHub issue procedures).



2. Project Management SOP / Work Instructions (WKI)

This is where the planning and execution of the project itself is governed.

Project Management SOP:

High-level rules for managing projects.

May state: “Projects should be managed using GitHub Projects, issues, and sprints.”

Defines responsibilities, reporting cadence, and artifacts (project wiki, boards).

Project Management WKI (Work Instruction):

Step-by-step how-to for this particular project (Red Witch).

Examples of instructions it could contain:

Create the Red Witch repository and project board on GitHub.

Create the Red Witch wiki and add project documentation.

Break requirements into issues on the project board.

Organize issues into sprints or Kanban columns.

Track progress according to the sprint plan and update the wiki.





Exactly — now you’ve landed on the **right concept**. Let’s clarify and tie all the pieces together.

---

### 1. **Project Initiation Document / Project Charter**

* **Purpose:** Formally authorizes the project and defines **what the project is, why it exists, and its high-level objectives**.
* **Key Elements:**

  * Project objectives and scope
  * High-level requirements (sometimes called **design inputs**)
  * Stakeholders and roles
  * High-level schedule, milestones, and resources
  * Authorization to proceed

In your workflow:

* **Design inputs (requirements)** are captured **as part of the charter or initiation record**.
* The charter is essentially **the official “green light”** to start creating work items, sprints, and project-specific artifacts.

---

### 2. **Where the SOPs and Project Docs Fit**

| Concept                            | Where it Lives                                | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Design inputs / requirements       | Project Charter / Project Initiation Document | High-level requirements that kick off the project            |
| How design changes are implemented | Design Control SOP                            | Governs the controlled steps to implement changes            |
| How work is tracked / managed      | Project Management SOP / WKI                  | Step-by-step workflow: GitHub setup, issues, sprints, boards |
| Project-specific documentation     | Project Wiki (Red Witch)                      | Detailed architecture, backlog, workflow instructions        |

---

### 3. **Flow of Work**

1. **Project Charter / Initiation Document:** Defines the project, design inputs, and authorizes work.
2. **Design Control SOP:** Any design changes or work derived from those inputs must follow the controlled process.
3. **Project Management SOP/WKI:** Specifies how to organize, plan, and track that work (GitHub issues, sprints, wiki).
4. **Red Witch Wiki:** Contains project-specific implementation details, documentation, and backlog.

---

✅ **Key Insight:**

The **charter is the starting point** — it authorizes the project, defines the initial requirements, and triggers all downstream processes: design control, project management workflow, and sprint planning.

Great idea 🚀 — if you treat **QMS docs like software artifacts**, then a GitHub Project board gives you **visibility, consistency, and traceability** across projects. Here’s a reusable template you can drop into a GitHub Project (classic Kanban or new Projects Beta):

---

# 📋 **GitHub Project Board Template for QMS Docs**

### **Columns**

1. **Backlog**

   * New document ideas, framework references, compliance needs.
   * Example cards: *Ontario Framework mapping*, *GDPR checklist draft*.

2. **In Draft**

   * Document is being written/structured.
   * Goal: get the first working version committed to the wiki/repo.

3. **In Review**

   * PR submitted, waiting for comments.
   * Reviewer checks for: completeness, compliance mapping, consistency.

4. **Approved for Use**

   * Document is approved for use in the current project.
   * Becomes the "design output" in QMS language.

5. **In Effectiveness Check**

   * Document is being used/applied in a live project (e.g. Red Witch).
   * Collect feedback, audit notes, lessons learned.

6. **Promoted to SOP**

   * Stable, proven instruction → generalized for organization-wide SOP library.
   * Linked to regulatory deliverables in the compliance matrix.

7. **Archived**

   * Superseded or retired docs.
   * Keep for historical/audit traceability.

---

### **Workflow (Card Lifecycle)**

1. **Backlog → In Draft**

   * Trigger: New doc identified, Issue opened.

2. **In Draft → In Review**

   * Trigger: First draft committed, PR opened.

3. **In Review → Approved for Use**

   * Trigger: Review complete, PR merged.

4. **Approved for Use → In Effectiveness Check**

   * Trigger: Applied in a project, tracked with evidence/issues.

5. **In Effectiveness Check → Promoted to SOP**

   * Trigger: Validation successful in at least one additional project.

6. **Any stage → Archived**

   * Trigger: Document deprecated or replaced.

---

### **Card Template (per document)**

When you create a card/issue for each doc, use this checklist inside:

```markdown
**Document:** [Name of doc]

**Status:**
- [ ] Drafted
- [ ] Reviewed
- [ ] Approved for use
- [ ] Effectiveness check completed
- [ ] Promoted to SOP

**Compliance Mapping:**  
- ISO/IEC 62304  
- ISO 13485  
- ISO 14971  
- GDPR  
- [add specifics]

**Evidence Links:**  
- Repo/Wiki page: [URL]  
- Compliance Matrix row: [URL]  
- Review PR: [URL]
```

---

### ✅ Benefits

* **Reusable** → you can copy this board for each project.
* **Traceable** → every doc has a lifecycle from draft → validated SOP.
* **Audit-ready** → you can show auditors exactly how a work instruction was created, reviewed, applied, and validated.
