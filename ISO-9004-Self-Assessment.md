# ISO 9004 Self Assessment

This document is the record of a Quality Management assessment of the Red Witch project conducted using the step-by-step method provided in ISO 9004:2009(E) Annex A section A.5.

1. Define the scope of the self-assessment in terms of the parts of the organization to be assessed and the type of the assessment, such as

    - self-assessment of key elements,
    - a self-assessment of detailed elements, based on this International Standard, or
    - a self-assessment of detailed elements based on this International Standard, with additional or new criteria or levels.


2. Identify who will be responsible for the self-assessment and when it will be carried out.

3. Determine how the self-assessment will be carried out, either by a team (cross-functional or other appropriate team) or by individuals. The appointment of a facilitator can assist the process.

4. Identify the maturity level for each of the organization's individual processes. This should be done by comparing the present situation in the organization to the examples that are listed in the tables, and by marking the elements that the organization is already applying; start at level 1 and progress to the higher maturity levels. The current maturity level will be the highest maturity level achieved with no preceding gaps up to that point.

5. Consolidate the results into a report. This provides a record of progress over time and can facilitate the communication of information, both internally and externally. The use of graphics in such a report can aid the communication of the results (see the example in Figure A.2).

6. Assess the current performance of the organization's processes and identify areas for improvement and/or innovation. These opportunities should be identified through the process and an action plan developed as a result of the assessment.
