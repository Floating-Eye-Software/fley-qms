---

### **4. Procedure**

#### **4.1 Initiating a Change**

1. Create a **GitHub Issue** to describe the proposed change, including:

   * Change reason and summary
   * Impact assessment
   * Related SOPs, WIs, or CAPAs

2. Create a **branch** from `main`:

   ```
   git checkout -b change/update-document-control
   ```

3. Implement changes in the branch.

4. Commit updates with a clear message referencing the CR Issue:

   ```
   git commit -m "Fixes #42 ‚Äì Updated numbering and revision control section"
   ```

---

#### **4.2 Submitting for Review**

1. Open a **Pull Request** (PR) to merge the branch into `main`.
2. PR title should summarize the change, e.g.:

   ```
   SOP-004_r2 ‚Äì Updated review and tagging section
   ```
3. PR description must include:

   * Link to CR Issue (e.g., `Fixes #42`)
   * Summary of changes
   * Any validation or verification results (if applicable)

---

#### **4.3 Review and Approval**

1. Reviewers evaluate the PR using GitHub‚Äôs review features:

   * ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù = formal approval
   * ‚ÄúRequest changes‚Äù = return to author for updates

2. Required reviewers are determined by the repository‚Äôs `CODEOWNERS` or approval matrix.

3. Approval in GitHub constitutes an **electronic signature** in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485 requirements.

---

#### **4.4 Merging and Tagging**

1. Once approved:

   * Merge the PR into the `main` branch.
   * Create a Git tag corresponding to the new revision (e.g., `SOP-004_r2`).
   * Push the tag:

     ```bash
     git push origin SOP-004_r2
     ```
2. The tag represents the official approved version.
3. Update the document header to reflect the new revision and effective date.

---

#### **4.5 Branch and Access Control**

1. The `main` branch is **protected**:

   * Requires PR review before merge
   * Prevents direct commits
   * Restricts deletion or force-push operations

2. All draft work occurs in feature branches:

   ```
   feature/update-sop-004
   ```

3. Obsolete branches may be deleted after the PR is merged.

---

#### **4.6 Handling Unintended Changes**

1. If an unapproved commit appears in `main`, open a CAPA Issue immediately.
2. Document:

   * Nature of the unintended change
   * Root cause analysis
   * Corrective and preventive actions
3. Revert the change via corrective PR and tag the corrected revision.

#### **4.7 Records and Retention**

| Record Type    | Description                  | Location   | Retention |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| GitHub Issues  | Change requests and CAPAs    | GitHub     | Permanent |
