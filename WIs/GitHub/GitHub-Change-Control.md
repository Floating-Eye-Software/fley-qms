# üß≠ **Work Instruction (WI): GitHub Pull Request and Branch Management**

**Document Number:** WI-005
**Revision:** r2
**Related SOPs:** Change Control, Document Control, Identification and Traceability
**Controlled Source:** [GitHub Repository URL]

---

## **1. Purpose**

To define the standardized method for proposing, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to QMS-controlled documents and configurations using GitHub Issues, branches, and Pull Requests (PRs).
This Work Instruction implements the Change Control process in a Git-based environment.

---

## **2. Scope**

Applies to all repositories containing QMS-controlled documentation or configuration data managed in GitHub, including Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), Work Instructions (WIs), Policies (POLs), and Records (RECs).

---

## **3. Responsibilities**

| Role                                 | Responsibilities                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Change Requestor (Author)**        | Initiates the change via a GitHub Issue and creates a branch implementing the update.      |
| **Reviewer / Approver**              | Reviews PRs for completeness, accuracy, and compliance before approval.                    |
| **Change Control Coordinator (CCC)** | Ensures each PR includes the correct Issue references, approvals, and tags before merging. |
| **Quality Manager**                  | Oversees adherence to change control and ensures retention of all electronic records.      |

---

## **4. Procedure**

### **4.1 Initiating a Change**

1. Open a **GitHub Issue** to serve as the Change Request (CR). Include:

   * Purpose and reason for change
   * Impact and risk assessment
   * Related SOPs, WIs, or CAPAs

2. Create a **branch** from the protected `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b change/update-document-control
   ```

3. Implement the required changes in the branch.

4. Commit with a clear message referencing the CR:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixes #42 ‚Äì Updated document numbering section per new SOP"
   ```

Each commit and Issue reference provides traceability per ISO 9001 ¬ß7.5.3 and ISO 13485 ¬ß4.2.4.

---

### **4.2 Submitting for Review**

1. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge the change branch into `main`.

2. PR title should clearly identify the document and revision, for example:

   ```
   SOP-004_r2 ‚Äì Updated review and tagging procedure
   ```

3. The PR description must include:

   * Link to the related Issue (CR), e.g. `Fixes #42`
   * Summary of changes
   * Verification or validation notes (if applicable)

4. The PR acts as the **formal review and approval record**.

---

### **4.3 Review and Approval**

1. Reviewers use GitHub‚Äôs built-in review tools:

   * **‚ÄúApprove‚Äù** = electronic approval
   * **‚ÄúRequest changes‚Äù** = return to author for correction

2. Required reviewers are defined in the repository‚Äôs `CODEOWNERS` file or approval matrix.

3. Approvals within GitHub constitute **electronic signatures** in accordance with 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485 ¬ß4.2.4.

4. Once all required reviewers have approved, the PR is ready to merge.

---

### **4.4 Merging and Tagging Approved Changes**

1. After approval:

   * The **Change Control Coordinator** merges the PR into the `main` branch.
   * Create a Git tag matching the document identifier and revision:

     ```bash
     git tag SOP-004_r2
     git push origin SOP-004_r2
     ```

2. The tag marks the **approved and effective revision**.

3. The **HEAD of `main`** always represents the **current approved version** published to the QMS Wiki or controlled site.

4. Approval metadata (reviewers, timestamp, linked CR, and tag) are stored automatically in GitHub and Git history ‚Äî no manual ‚ÄúApproved By‚Äù or ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù fields are required in the document header.

---

### **4.5 Branch and Access Control**

1. The `main` branch must be **protected** to ensure control integrity:

   * PR review required before merging
   * No direct commits
   * No force pushes or branch deletions
   * Require status checks to pass (optional)

2. Draft or in-progress changes must occur in branches named by convention:

   ```
   feature/update-sop-004
   fix/typo-wi-002
   change/update-qms-template
   ```

3. After the PR is merged, branches may be deleted to reduce clutter.
   The full history remains preserved in the repository and associated PR.

---

### **4.6 Handling Unintended or Noncompliant Changes**

1. If an unauthorized change is detected in `main`, immediately:

   * Open a **CAPA Issue** referencing the affected commit or PR.
   * Document the event, impact, and root cause.

2. Revert the change using a corrective PR, referencing the CAPA:

   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

3. Tag the corrected version (e.g., `_r3`) and close the CAPA once verified.

### **4.7 Records and Retention**

| Record Type             | Description                                                | Location            | Retention |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| GitHub Issues           | Change Requests (CRs), CAPAs, and linked documentation     | GitHub              | Permanent |
| Pull Requests           | Review, approval, and merge record (electronic signatures) | GitHub              | Permanent |
| Commits                 | Change implementation history                              | GitHub Repository   | Permanent |
| Tags                    | Approved revision identifiers                              | GitHub              | Permanent |
| Branch protection rules | Configuration record of controls                           | Repository Settings | Permanent |

The GitHub system itself serves as the **record of change control**, approval, and traceability.

## **5. Integration with Related Procedures**

This WI implements and interfaces with:

* **SOP ‚Äì Change Control:** Defines system-level requirements for evaluating, approving, and implementing changes.
* **SOP ‚Äì Document Control:** Establishes that the HEAD of `main` is the controlled source.
* **WI ‚Äì GitHub Version Control and Traceability:** Provides technical traceability and audit commands.
