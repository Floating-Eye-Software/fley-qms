## **5. Procedure**

### **5.1 Leadership and QMS Governance**

1. **Quality Policy**

   * Stored in the Wiki under `/Quality-Policy`.
   * Reviewed annually via a GitHub Issue labeled `Management Review`.

2. **Roles & Responsibilities**

   * Documented in `/docs/OrganizationChart.md`.
   * Updated via Pull Request; approved by Top Management.

3. **Management Review**

   * Initiated as a GitHub Issue with label `Management Review`.
   * Links to:

     * Risk Register Project
     * Objectives Project
     * Audit results (Issues labeled `Audit`)
     * Feedback and customer satisfaction data
   * Minutes are captured in the Issue body or attached as a PDF.
   * On completion, the Issue is closed and archived under `/records/management-reviews/`.

---

### **5.2 Quality Planning and Objectives**

1. **Setting Objectives**

   * Each **Quality Objective** is created as a **GitHub Issue** labeled `Objective`.
   * The Issue includes:

     * Objective title and description
     * Metric / target value
     * Responsible owner
     * Due date and milestones
     * Links to related processes or SOPs

2. **Tracking Objectives**

   * Objectives are tracked using a **Project Board** named **‚ÄúQMS Objectives‚Äù**, with columns:

     * Planned
     * In Progress
     * Achieved
     * Reviewed
   * Each Objective Issue is moved across columns as progress is made.

3. **Review**

   * Reviewed quarterly or during Management Review.
   * Objective effectiveness is noted in the corresponding Issue comments.

### **5.3 Risk and Opportunity Management**

1. **Creating Risks or Opportunities**

   * Each identified risk or opportunity is a **GitHub Issue** labeled `Risk` or `Opportunity`.
   * Include:

     * Description
     * Source (e.g., audit, feedback, process change)
     * Likelihood (Low / Medium / High)
     * Impact (Low / Medium / High)
     * Mitigation or enhancement plan
     * Owner and due date

2. **Tracking**

   * Risks and opportunities are maintained on a **Project Board** titled **‚ÄúQMS Risk Register‚Äù**, with columns:

     * Identified
     * Action Planned
     * Mitigation in Progress
     * Closed / Controlled

3. **Actions**

   * Mitigation or improvement actions are tracked as linked Issues (labeled `Action` or `CAPA`).
   * Progress and closure are recorded in comments.

4. **Review**

   * Quality Manager reviews open risks quarterly.
   * Major items are included in the next Management Review.

5. **Records**

   * Closed risk Issues are retained indefinitely as QMS records.
   * Optionally exported quarterly to `/records/risk-register/YYYY-MM/`.

---

### **5.4 Change Control and Continual Improvement**

1. **Initiating a Change**

   * Changes to processes, documentation, or the QMS are made through **Pull Requests**.
   * Each PR must:

     * Reference the related Change Control Issue (label `Change Request`).
     * Describe the change and justification.
     * Be reviewed and approved by the Quality Manager and Process Owner.

2. **Approval**

   * Approval is documented through GitHub‚Äôs PR review system (electronic signature).
   * Merge = authorized implementation.

3. **Post-Implementation Review**

   * Linked Change Request Issue is updated with the implementation result and closed.

4. **Continual Improvement**

   * Improvements, suggestions, and CAPAs are logged as Issues labeled `Improvement`.
   * Reviewed and prioritized in the **QMS Improvement Project Board**.

---

### **5.5 Document Control and Record Retention**

* Follows the **Documented Information Control SOP (QMS-SOP-03)**.
* All controlled documents are stored in `/docs` or the Wiki.
* Obsolete revisions are archived automatically by Git version control.
* Records (closed Issues, PRs, and exports) are backed up regularly.

---

## **6. Backup and Record Export**

1. Use a GitHub Action or external tool to:

   * Export all open and closed Issues (including comments and attachments) quarterly.
   * Save under `/records/github-exports/YYYY-MM/`.
2. The export serves as the **official QMS record backup**.
3. For redundancy, repositories should also be cloned to an offline backup location.

## üí° **Implementation Notes**

* GitHub repositories and Projects act as **living QMS records**, fully traceable through commits, Issues, and pull request history.
* This WI provides a complete implementation framework for ISO 9001 risk-based thinking, leadership accountability, and continual improvement ‚Äî entirely within GitHub.
* If your organization later uses other tools (e.g., Confluence, Jira), this WI can reference external procedures while keeping GitHub as the master control system.
