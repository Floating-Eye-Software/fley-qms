---

### **4. Procedure**

#### **4.1 Document Numbering**

1. Document numbers follow the format:

   ```
   [PREFIX]-[###]_[Title].md
   ```

   Example: `SOP-003_Document-Control.md`

2. Prefix conventions:

   | Type                         | Prefix |
   | ---------------------------- | ------ |
   | Standard Operating Procedure | SOP    |
   | Work Instruction             | WI     |
   | Template                     | TPL    |
   | Policy                       | POL    |
   | Record                       | REC    |

3. Sequential numbering is assigned manually by the author, verified by the reviewer to ensure uniqueness.

---

#### **4.2 File Header Metadata**

Each controlled document must include the following Markdown header at the top of the file:

```markdown
# SOP-003 ‚Äì Document Control
**Revision:** r1  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Approved By:** [Name / Title]  
**Controlled Source:** https://github.com/[org]/[repo]/SOPs/SOP-003_Document-Control.md
```

Optional fields (e.g., ‚ÄúSupersedes‚Äù or ‚ÄúObsolete Date‚Äù) may be added if applicable.

---

#### **4.3 Creating and Tagging Approved Versions**

1. All document updates are submitted via a **Pull Request (PR)**.

2. After review and approval, the PR is merged into the `main` branch.

3. Create a Git tag to mark the approved revision:

   ```bash
   git tag SOP-003_r2
   git push origin SOP-003_r2
   ```

4. The tag name must match the document identifier and revision number.

5. The tag and corresponding commit serve as the **official record** of approval and revision.

---

#### **4.4 Locating the Next Available Document Number**

1. Review the `/SOPs`, `/WIs`, or applicable folder to determine the next sequential number.
2. Search for existing filenames using:

   ```bash
   ls SOP-* | sort
   ```
3. Assign the next number in sequence.

---

#### **4.5 Managing Obsolete or Superseded Documents**

1. When a document is replaced:

   * Update the header to indicate **OBSOLETE** and include the superseding document number.
   * Optionally move the file to `/archive/`.
2. The previous tag remains in Git as a permanent record.

---

#### **4.6 Viewing Revision History**

To view all revisions and authors for a document:

```bash
git log --follow --pretty=format:"%h %ad %an %s" --date=iso path/to/SOP-003_Document-Control.md
```

This provides the traceability record required by ISO 9001 Clause 7.5.
