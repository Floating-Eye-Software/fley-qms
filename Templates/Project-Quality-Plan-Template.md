## **1. QMS Activity Configuration (Project-Specific)**

> The PQP defines how this project implements the Floating Eye Software (FLEY) Quality Management System (QMS).
> It specifies which **standards**, **SOPs**, **Work Instructions (WIs)**, and **tools** are applied to meet quality, regulatory, and operational requirements.
>
> This configuration ensures each project executes all required QMS activities while allowing flexibility in tools and frameworks.

Each project shall define its **QMS configuration**, identifying which **Work Instructions (WIs)** and **tools** implement each SOP.
All QMS activities are **mandatory**, even if achieved using different frameworks or infrastructures.

| SOP / QMS Activity                           | Selected Work Instruction / Method                                                                                          | Tool / Platform (if applicable) | Notes / Comments                                                            |

**Configuration Rules**

* All SOPs remain in effect; WIs/tools define *how* compliance is achieved.
* Configuration must be approved by the **Project Manager** and **Quality Representative** before project kickoff.
* Any configuration change must follow **Change Control SOP**.
* Standards and frameworks applied (e.g., ISO 9001, ISO 13485, ISO 14971) depend on the **intended use** and regulatory classification of the product/service.

### ðŸ’¡ *Implementation Notes*

* The **QMS Activity Configuration** (Section 1) defines this projectâ€™s operational QMS profile.
* All SOPs apply; WIs/tools specify execution details.
* Any deviation requires a formal **Change Request**.
* The **Design Control Plan (DCP)** must reference this PQP to stay aligned with the approved configuration.
