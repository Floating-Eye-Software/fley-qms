# ðŸ“˜ **IEC 62304:2006 â€” Medical Device Software Life Cycle**

### Overview

IEC 62304 defines the **software development life cycle (SDLC) requirements** for medical device software. It applies to all safety classes (A, B, C), with increasing rigor depending on risk.

It integrates with **ISO 13485** (quality system), **ISO 14971** (risk management), and **21 CFR 820.30** (design controls).

### Gaps / Notes

* **Software safety classification (4.2)** should be explicitly tracked in PQPs (not just implied by risk class).
* **Maintenance process (Clause 6)** could need a dedicated SOP to avoid scattering tasks across CAPA + release.
* **Problem resolution process (Clause 9)** overlaps with CAPA â€” may need a software-specific WI for clarity.
