## Notes

* Clauses marked **TBD** indicate SOPs pending drafting or finalization.
* The `[[Page Name]]` links connect directly to existing wiki pages within the Red Witch QMS.
* Evidence examples provide auditors and internal stakeholders with typical sources used to verify compliance.
* Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) and complaint handling are emphasized more explicitly in ISO 13485 than in ISO 9001, requiring specific SOPs.
