### **Self-Assessment / Maturity Approach**

* Use a maturity/self-assessment tool (ISO 9004 suggests one) to assess how fully you’ve adopted guided practices. ([iso.org][1])
* You may use or adapt third-party checklists (e.g. SEPT checklist for ISO 9004) as inspiration. ([complianceonline.com][2])
* Document your assessment and use results as inputs into your **Continuous Improvement Plan**.

---

### **How FLEY Uses ISO 9004 as Guiding “Stretch Goals”**

* ISO 9001 remains the baseline compliance and control standard.
* ISO 9004 is used internally as a **maturity & strategic framework** to push beyond conformance.
* You selectively adopt guidance statements as **improvement objectives**, not all at once.
* Each future improvement project (e.g. knowledge management, environmental resource considerations, innovation pipeline) may be mapped to one or more ISO 9004 clauses for traceability.

---

### **Usage / Audit Notes**

* This page is a **non-certifiable / internal guidance mapping**, not a requirement-driven compliance index.
* During internal audits or management review, you may review your maturity progress against ISO 9004 guidance.
* Auditors may appreciate seeing that you not only meet ISO 9001 but are looking forward with ISO 9004-style maturity goals.
