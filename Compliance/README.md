This directory contains the **Compliance and Standards Register** for the  
**Floating Eye Software Quality Management System (FLEY QMS)**.

These documents identify the external standards, regulations, and frameworks that the QMS aligns with.  
Each standard or regulation may have its own mapping document showing how FLEY policies, SOPs, and work instructions meet the applicable clauses.

## **Contents**

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| [Compliance Index](README.md) | Master register of applicable standards and regulations. |
| [ISO 9001](ISO-9001.md) | Quality Management Systems — Requirements (core framework standard). |

> Additional standards (e.g., ISO 13485, ISO 14971, IEC 62304, privacy and security frameworks) will be added as they are mapped and adopted.

---

## **Purpose**

The compliance documentation supports:

* **Audit readiness** – Quick reference to standards and evidence of conformance.
* **Traceability** – Links between standards, QMS documents, and GitHub artifacts (Issues, PRs, records).
* **Scalability** – New frameworks can be added as FLEY expands to manage additional projects.

---

## **Usage Guidelines**

1. Use the [Compliance Index](README.md) as the starting point for standards review.
2. Each standard mapping file should include:
   * Scope and relevance to FLEY operations.
   * Cross-references to SOPs, WIs, and other QMS documents.
   * Evidence locations (e.g., GitHub Issues, PRs, or project boards).
3. When a new standard is added:
   * Create a new `.md` file in this directory.
   * Update the [Compliance Index](README.md).
   * Link related documents in SOPs, WIs, or plans.
