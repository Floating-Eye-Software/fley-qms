# **ISO 9001 Compliance & QMS Mapping**

ISO 9001:2015 — *Quality Management Systems – Requirements* — defines the framework for establishing, maintaining, and continually improving the organization’s quality management system (QMS).

## **Purpose**

This page shows how **FLEY’s QMS** aligns with ISO 9001:2015 + Amd 1:2024.
It maps ISO clauses to the corresponding **SOPs** and **Work Instructions (WIs)** and lists the records that provide objective evidence of conformity.

## **How to Use This Page**

* **Internal Audits:** Find which SOP/WI demonstrates compliance with each ISO clause.
* **External Audits:** Provide direct links to GitHub Wiki pages and repository evidence.
* **Continual Improvement:** Update this matrix after each approved SOP/WI or system change.

## **QMS Structure and Integration**

The QMS operates through GitHub using these connected workflows:

1. **Document Control & Versioning** → Managed by [[GitHub Document Control]] and [[GitHub Version Control]].
2. **Change Control** → Implemented via [[GitHub Change Control]] and pull-request reviews.
3. **Identification & Traceability** → Via commit metadata (author, date, SHA, tag).
4. **Leadership & Planning** → Executed in [[GitHub QMS Operations]] (WI).
5. **Project Management & Improvement** → Through [[GitHub Project Management]] boards for product and QMS projects.

---

## **Review and Maintenance**

* This page is reviewed **annually** during **Management Review**.
* Updates are made via controlled pull requests.
* All evidence is retained under the rules defined in [[Document Control SOP]].
