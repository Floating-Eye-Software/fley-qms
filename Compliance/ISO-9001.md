## **Purpose of This Page**

This page demonstrates how FLEY’s QMS aligns with ISO 9001:2015 requirements.
It maps **ISO 9001 clauses** to corresponding **QMS processes / SOPs** and identifies the **records and evidence** used to demonstrate conformity.

It serves as a compliance reference for internal and external audits and supports continual improvement of the QMS.

## **How to Use This Page**

* **Internal Audit Preparation:**
  Use this page to identify the QMS process or SOP that corresponds to each ISO 9001 clause.

* **External Audit Reference:**
  Present this mapping to demonstrate compliance and traceability between ISO requirements, documented processes, and supporting evidence.

* **Continual Improvement:**
  Update the matrix whenever a new SOP, WI, or process change is approved.

---

## **Notes**

* The QMS is organized into three **core workflows**:

  1. **QMS Operation** – maintaining and improving the system.
  2. **QMS Creation** – developing and documenting the framework.
  3. **Product Development** – applying the QMS to deliver products.

* All evidence is maintained in controlled **GitHub repositories**, **Wiki pages**, and **project boards** per [[Document Control SOP]].

* This mapping is reviewed annually during **Management Review** and updated as processes evolve.
