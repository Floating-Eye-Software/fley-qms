### Notes & Guidance

* **TBD Entries**
  Where “(TBD)” appears, it means you haven’t created the SOP / document yet — you should plan to develop those to complete your compliance mapping.

* **Link Style**
  The `[[Page Name]]` links point to wiki pages in your repository (e.g. `Quality Manual`, `Traceability SOP`, etc.). Make sure those pages exist or are created with matching titles.

* **Evidence Scope**
  The “Typical Evidence / Records” column is illustrative: you should gather records that *clearly link* process outputs to ISO requirements for audits.

* **Exclusions & Applicability**
  If certain ISO clauses don’t apply to your operation (e.g. design in a non-design organization), document those exclusions with rationale in the Quality Manual or Scope statement.
