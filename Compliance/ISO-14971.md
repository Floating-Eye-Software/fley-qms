# ðŸ“˜ **ISO 14971:2019 â€” Medical Devices Risk Management**

### Overview

ISO 14971 specifies a process for identifying, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risks associated with medical devices. It is tightly linked to **ISO 13485:2016** and **21 CFR 820.30**.

Risk management is lifecycle-wide: from design through production and post-market activities.

### Gaps / Notes

* **Clause 4.4 (Risk Management Plan)** should be explicitly required in each PQP (may need a dedicated WI).
* **Post-production monitoring (Clause 10)** overlaps with complaint handling (21 CFR 820.198) â€” might need a dedicated SOP to unify.
* **Benefitâ€“risk analysis (7.4)** may need more explicit treatment in design reviews.
