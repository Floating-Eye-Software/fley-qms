# Quality Plan – Phase 1 (Red Witch Project)

---

## 1. Purpose

This plan defines the initial quality objectives and approach for the Red Witch software development project. It establishes Red Witch as both a product development effort and a pilot activity for creating the organization’s quality management framework, including the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

---

## 2. Scope

* **Project-specific:** Red Witch software development activities.
* **Organization-wide quality foundation:** Processes and practices identified in Red Witch will be generalized into SOPs for future projects.
* **Compliance objectives:** Continuous alignment with applicable standards and regulations (ISO 9004, GDPR, ISO/IEC 62304, ISO 9001 as relevant).

---

## 3. Quality Objectives

1. **Establish SOP Framework through Red Witch:**

   * Use Red Witch’s project-level documents (Software Development Plan, Pull Request Procedure, Risk Management activities, etc.) as inputs for drafting general-purpose SOPs.
   * Identify which practices are repeatable and scalable across projects.
   * Publish first versions of:
     * Design Control SOP
     * Project Management SOP
     * Risk Management SOP
     * Configuration/Change Control SOP

2. **ISO 9004 Self-Assessment:**

   * Perform an organizational self-assessment against ISO 9004 to evaluate quality maturity.
   * Use findings to identify improvement opportunities and align SOP development.

3. **GDPR-Compliant Privacy Process:**

   * Establish a process for handling personal data in compliance with GDPR.
   * Apply this to Red Witch (if applicable) as a test case.
   * Formalize as a Privacy and Data Protection SOP.

4. **Quality Metrics (initial):**

   * Traceability from requirements → code → tests.
   * Pull request review coverage (≥ 1 review per PR).
   * Compliance evidence collected (ISO 9004 self-assessment record, GDPR checklist).

---

## 4. Quality Processes

* **Development Process:** Governed by the Red Witch Software Development Plan (SDP).
* **Review & Approval:** PR reviews and design reviews are mandatory for all high-risk changes.
* **Feedback Loop:** Lessons learned during Red Witch are captured and classified as either:
  * *Project-specific guidance*, or
  * *Candidate SOP material*.
* **Audit & Assessment:**
  * Internal self-assessment against ISO 9004.
  * GDPR compliance audit for Red Witch project practices.
